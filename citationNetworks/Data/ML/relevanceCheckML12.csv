A holistic approach to grazing management requires the estimation of grazing timing, frequency, and season length, as well as the overall grazing intensity. However, traditional grazing monitoring methods require frequent field visits, which can be labor intensive and logistically demanding to implement, especially in remote areas. Questionnaire surveys of farmers are also widely used to collect information on grazing parameters, however there can be concerns regarding the reliability of the data collected. To improve the reliability of grazing data collected and decrease the required labor, we tested for the first time whether a novel combination of autonomous recording units and the semi-automated detection algorithms of livestock vocalizations could provide insight on grazing activity at the selected areas of the Greek Rhodope mountain range. Our results confirm the potential of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) techniques as a cost-efficient method for acquiring high resolution spatiotemporal data on grazing patterns. Additionally, we evaluate the three algorithms that we developed for detecting cattle, sheep/goat, and livestock bell sounds, and make them available to the broader scientific community. We conclude with suggestions on ways that acoustic monitoring can further contribute to managing legal and illegal grazing, and offer a list of priorities for related future research. © 2021 by the authors.","Acoustic sensors; Detection algorithm; Grazing season; Grazing timing; Passive acoustic monitoring","Acoustic measuring instruments; Conservation; Frequency estimation; Surveys; Acoustic monitoring; Passive acoustic monitoring; Pastoral communities; Protected area management; Questionnaire surveys; Scientific community; Semi-automated detection; Spatio-temporal data; Agriculture","Kariuki, R.W., Western, D., Willcock, S., Marchant, R., Assessing Interactions between Agriculture, Livestock Grazing and Wildlife Conservation Land Uses: A Historical Example from East Africa (2021) Land, 10, p. 46. , [CrossRef]; Balzan, M.V., Sadula, R., Scalvenzi, L., Assessing Ecosystem Services Supplied by Agroecosystems in Mediterranean Europe: A Literature Review (2020) Land, 9, p. 245. , [CrossRef]; van der Meijden, E., Wijn, M., Verkaar, H.J., Defence and Regrowth, Alternative Plant Strategies in the Struggle against Herbivores (1988) Oikos, 51, pp. 355-363. , [CrossRef]; Davidson, D.W., The Effects of Herbivory and Granivory on Terrestrial Plant Succession (1993) Oikos, 68, pp. 23-35. , [CrossRef]; Vickery, J., Gill, J., Managing grassland for wild geese in Britain: A review (1999) Biol.

Compared to standard helicopter or fixed‐wing aerial surveys, TIR flights can be conducted at higher altitudes translating into greater spatial coverage and increased observer safety; however, monetary costs are much greater. Further, there is no consensus on whether TIR surveys offer improved detection. Consequently, we performed a study to compare results of a TIR and helicopter survey of bison (Bison bison) on the Powell Plateau in Grand Canyon National Park, USA. We also compared results of both surveys to estimates obtained using a larger dataset of bison helicopter detections along the entire North Rim of the Grand Canyon. Observers in the TIR survey counted fewer individual bison than helicopter observers (101 to 127) and the TIR survey cost was 367% higher. Additionally, the TIR estimate was 18.8% lower than the estimate obtained using a larger dataset, while the comparative helicopter survey was 9.3% lower. Despite our small sample size, we found that helicopter surveys are currently the best method for estimating bison abundances in dense canopy cover sites due to ostensibly more accurate estimates and lower cost compared to TIR surveys. Additional research will be needed to evaluate the efficacy of these methods, as well as very high resolution satellite imagery, for bison populations in more open landscapes. © 2021 by the authors.

Methods to estimate home ranges have swiftly progressed by dynamically accounting for various sources of bias. Across that period of growth, one potentially influential source of bias has yet to be robustly scrutinized. Animals inhabiting the terrestrial spatial domain make movement decisions in environments with variable landscape complexity. Despite that reality, home range estimation methods tend to be informed by two-dimensional (2D) data (i.e., x and y coordinates), which analytically presume that these landscapes are flat. This analytical tendency potentially misrepresents the configuration and size of animal home range estimates. To examine the prevalence of this bias, we reviewed literature of terrestrial animal home range estimation published between 2000 and 2019. We recorded the proportion of studies that (1) recognized and (2) incorporated landscape complexity. Over 22.0% (n = 271) of the 1,203 studies recognized the importance of landscape complexity for animal movement. Interestingly, just 0.7% (n = 8) incorporated landscape complexity into the home range estimation. We infer then that landscape complexity represents an important source of bias resulting in the underestimation of terrestrial animal home range size. Given the influence of landscape complexity on terrestrial animal decision making, energetics, and fitness, our analysis highlights an important gap in current home range methodologies. We discuss the implications of our analysis for biased understandings of terrestrial animal spatial ecology with subsequent impacts on management and conservation practices built upon these estimates. © 2021 by the Ecological Society of America.","fractal dimension; home range estimation; landscape complexity; scale; spatial dimensionality; spatial domainality; terrestrial wildlife; topography","complexity; conservation management; estimation method; home range; landscape ecology; terrestrial ecosystem; animal; ecology; ecosystem; homing behavior; movement (physiology); Animals; Ecology; Ecosystem; Homing Behavior; Movement","Anderson, D.P., Turner, M.G., Forester, J.D., Zhu, J., Boyce, M.S., Beyer, H., Stowell, L., Scale-dependent summer resource selection by reintroduced elk in Wisconsin, USA (2005) Journal of Wildlife Management, 69, pp. 298-310; Badgley, C., Tectonics, topography, and mammalian diversity (2010) Ecography, 33, pp. 220-231; Bell, S.S., McCoy, E.D., Mushinsky, H.R., (2012) Habitat structure: The physical arrangement of objects in space, , Springer Science & Business Media, Suffolk, UK; Benson, E., (2010) Wired wilderness: Technologies of tracking and the making of modern wildlife, , JHU Press, Baltimore, Maryland, USA; Burt, W.H., Territoriality and home range concepts as applied to mammals (1943) Journal of Mammalogy, 24, pp. 346-352; Cagnacci, F., Boitani, L., Powell, R.A., Boyce, M.S., Animal ecology meets GPS-based radiotelemetry: a perfect storm of opportunities and challenges (2010) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 365, pp. 2157-2162; Campbell, T.A., Laseter, B.R., Ford, W.M., Miller, K.V., Topographic home ranges of white-tailed deer in the central Appalachians (2004) Southeastern Naturalist, 3, pp. 645-652; Davies, A.B., Asner, G.P., Advances in animal ecology from 3D-LiDAR ecosystem mapping (2014) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 29, pp. 681-691; Deuel, N.R., Conner, L.M., Miller, K.V., Chamberlain, M.J., Cherry, M.J., Tannenbaum, L.V., Gray fox home range, spatial overlap, mated pair interactions and extra-territorial forays in southwestern Georgia, USA (2017) Wildlife Biology, 2017, p. wlb.00326; Dillon, A., Kelly, M.J., Ocelot home range, overlap and density: comparing radio telemetry with camera trapping (2008) Journal of Zoology, 275, pp. 391-398; Downs, J.A., Gates, R.J., Murray, A.T., Estimating carrying capacity for sandhill cranes using habitat suitability and spatial optimization models (2008) Ecological Modelling, 214, pp. 284-292; Farhadinia, M.S., Heit, D.R., Montgomery, R.A., Johnson, P.J., Hobeali, K., Hunter, L.T.B., Macdonald, D.W., Vertical relief facilitates spatial segregation of a high density large carnivore population (2019) Oikos, 129, pp. 346-355; Ferrarini, A., Giglio, G., Pellegrino, S.C., Frassanito, A.G., Gustin, M., A new methodology for computing birds’ 3D home ranges (2018) Avian Research, 9, p. 19; Fisher, D.O., Lara, M.C., Effects of body size and home range on access to mates and paternity in male bridled nailtail wallabies (1999) Animal Behaviour, 58, pp. 121-130; Fleming, C.H., Fagan, W.F., Mueller, T., Olson, K.A., Leimgruber, P., Calabrese, J.M., Rigorous home range estimation with movement data: a new autocorrelated kernel density estimator (2015) Ecology, 96, pp. 1182-1188; Forrest, J.L., Wikramanayake, E., Shrestha, R., Areendran, G., Gyeltshen, K., Maheshwari, A., Mazumdar, S., Thapa, K., Conservation and climate change: Assessing the vulnerability of snow leopard habitat to treeline shift in the Himalaya (2012) Biological Conservation, 150, pp. 129-135; Game, E.T., Kareiva, P., Possingham, H.P., Six common mistakes in conservation priority setting (2013) Conservation Biology, 27, pp. 480-485; Gautestad, A.O., Mysterud, I., Complex animal distribution and abundance from memony-dependent kinetics (2006) Ecological Complexity, 3, pp. 44-55; Gitzen, R.A., Millspaugh, J.J., Kernohan, B.J., Bandwidth selection for fixed-kernel analysis of animal utilization distributions (2006) Journal of Wildlife Management, 70, pp. 1334-1344; Greenberg, D.B., McClintock, W.J., Remember the third dimension: Terrain modeling improves estimates of snake home range size (2008) Copeia, 2008, pp. 801-806; Heidemann, H.K., LiDAR metadata (2012) Manual of airborne topographic lidar, pp. 437-470. , Pages, M.

However, increasing anthropogenic pressure in these regions is one major factor behind habitat loss and rising carnivore-human conflict. We mapped the suitable habitat and estimated the niche overlap of both species in the study landscape. Further, we assessed the habitat quality, identified corridors and quantified land sharing by both species. The anthropogenic disturbance (human settlements) was found to be one of the most significant contributors for both species. The higher Schoener's D (0.612) and Hellinger's based I value (0.858) indicates a considerable niche overlap of about 3529 km2. We observed a high level of fragmentation in suitable patches of Grey Wolf compared to the Striped Hyaena. For both Striped Hyaena and Grey Wolf, connectivity exists among the large patch of western and southern Purulia and Bankura. The Grey Wolf corridors in the Jhargram district were also found connected with other areas. We found that both the species, which are generally known rivals showing tolerance towards each other, which is an strong evidence of land sharing among the species. We recommend that the suitable patches and corridors identified in the study may be prioritized for conservation and management. © 2021","Biological corridors; Ensemble habitat modeling; Indian Grey Wolf; Resource poor landscape; South Bengal; Striped Hyaena","","AbiSaid, M., Dloniak, S.M.D., (2015), Hyaena hyaena.

This is particularly useful at sites without human impacts, as it allows for the investigation of the natural factors influencing nesting patterns and great ape abundance. We provide a small-scale study of sympatric great ape nests in an unlogged old-growth forest without poaching activities. We conducted a line transect survey (52 km total effort) around Mbeli Bai, a forest clearing in Nouabalé–Ndoki National Park, Congo, applying on-site nest decay rates and assigning nest builder using logistic regression. We found a high occurrence of monodominant Gilbertiodendron dewevrei at Mbeli Bai (34%) that correlates with low great ape densities at Mbeli Bai. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) showed a preference for nesting in trees in closed canopy monodominant forest. We found a low percentage of gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) nests in mixed species forest (35%) and a higher percentage in trees (64%) compared to other study sites. However, generalized additive models found higher gorilla nest encounter rates in mixed species forest with dense understory than in monodominant forest and open understory. We found no indication of higher gorilla densities close to Mbeli Bai than elsewhere, and line transect estimates were lower than the number of gorillas revealed from direct observations. There were substantial differences between our findings and those for nearby sites, demonstrating the utility of small-scale comparisons to further understand the factors determining chimpanzee and gorilla densities within and between sites and the limitations of nest surveys. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Chimpanzee; Congo Basin; Direct observation; Gorilla; Nest survey; Small-scale survey","comparative study; ecological impact; environmental factor; food availability; human activity; nest; nesting; old-growth forest; poaching; population density; population distribution; primate; Congo; Mbeli Bai; Nouabale-Ndoki National Park; Gorilla gorilla; Gorilla gorilla gorilla; Hominidae","Anderson, K.P., Burnham, D.A., Model selection and multi-model inference: A practical information-Theoretic Approach (2nd ed.)

We document and analyse BigMonth2020, a month-long birdwatching event across Java and Bali, publicised through social media and incentivised with grants and competitions. Over 20,000 lists containing 100,000 bird records were submitted to the ‘Burungnesia’ phone application. Spatial coverage extended to 71% of the islands’ 3408 atlas grid squares (6.9 × 6.9 km), including 1613 previously undocumented squares, with 353 bird species recorded, representing 74% of Java and Bali's avifauna excluding vagrants; 27 threatened species were recorded, with new records for 204 grid squares. Almost 25% of contributors were female, 72% were under 30 years old, and most were graduates and members of birdwatching clubs. The project cost less than US$10,000 to run, and serves as a model for rapidly establishing a distributional baseline for monitoring biodiversity trajectories in the tropics. © 2021","Biodiversity monitoring; Citizen science; Java; Southeast Asia; Species distribution modelling; Threatened species","","(2020), http://nigeriabirdatlas.adu.org.za/aboutus.php, APLORI Nigeria bird atlas project.

Dung surveys have been conducted at the landscape scale and confirmed the overwhelming impact of anthropogenic activities on forest elephants. We present results from a small-scale survey in a pristine protected area without anthropogenic activities to elucidate the ecological factors influencing forest elephant density. We conducted a line transect dung survey in a small study area (110 km2) around Mbeli Bai, a natural forest clearing in the Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park, Republic of Congo, and compare results with a landscape survey conducted during the same period. We used habitat specific dung decay data collected on site to estimate elephant density using distance sampling. We fitted Generalized Additive Models to elephant dung encounter rate using explanatory variables collected during the transect survey and from geospatial data. The small-scale survey revealed a precise estimate of forest elephant density that was twice as high as the result from a landscape survey with higher density in mixed species forest for the small-scale survey. We could not find an impact of the proximity of forest clearings and proximity to rivers at the small scale. Fine-scale habitat features, e.g. degree of canopy and understorey closure, had little explanatory power for elephant dung encounter rate. Small-scale dung surveys are a useful method to reveal spatio-temporal variation in forest elephant density and distribution which can inform conservation practitioners in a timely manner.

If done well, selective logging can be an important way of supporting local economies while minimally impacting wildlife. However, most studies on how selective logging affects wildlife come from sites that have been logged some time ago, often a decade or more. Here we assess how logging affects species assemblages in the very short term, immediately after the cessation of timber operations. We estimated overall mammal species richness in unlogged forest, previously logged forest, and an active logging concession in Indonesian Borneo using rarefaction-extrapolation-based diversity estimators. We found that estimated species richness did not differ significantly between unlogged forest (15.5 ± 2.82 species), previously logged forest (14.5 ± 2.10), or recently logged sites (14.2 ± 1.45) sites. Our findings suggest that the short-term impacts of properly managed selective logging are on par with the longer-term impacts that have been assessed in many prior studies. © 2021","Biodiversity; Land sharing; Land sparing; Sustainable development; Timber harvest; Tropical rainforest","","Abood, S.A., Lee, J.S.H., Burivalova, Z., Garcia-Ulloa, J., Koh, L.P., Relative contributions of the logging, fiber, oil palm, and mining industries to forest loss in Indonesia (2015) Conserv.

Wilmers, C.C., Center for Integrated Spatial Research, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, United States","Human activity and land use change impact every landscape on Earth, driving declines in many animal species while benefiting others. Species ecological and life history traits may predict success in human-dominated landscapes such that only species with “winning” combinations of traits will persist in disturbed environments. However, this link between species traits and successful coexistence with humans remains obscured by the complexity of anthropogenic disturbances and variability among study systems. We compiled detection data for 24 mammal species from 61 populations across North America to quantify the effects of (1) the direct presence of people and (2) the human footprint (landscape modification) on mammal occurrence and activity levels. Thirty-three percent of mammal species exhibited a net negative response (i.e., reduced occurrence or activity) to increasing human presence and/or footprint across populations, whereas 58% of species were positively associated with increasing disturbance. However, apparent benefits of human presence and footprint tended to decrease or disappear at higher disturbance levels, indicative of thresholds in mammal species’ capacity to tolerate disturbance or exploit human-dominated landscapes. Species ecological and life history traits were strong predictors of their responses to human footprint, with increasing footprint favoring smaller, less carnivorous, faster-reproducing species. The positive and negative effects of human presence were distributed more randomly with respect to species trait values, with apparent winners and losers across a range of body sizes and dietary guilds. Differential responses by some species to human presence and human footprint highlight the importance of considering these two forms of human disturbance separately when estimating anthropogenic impacts on wildlife. Our approach provides insights into the complex mechanisms through which human activities shape mammal communities globally, revealing the drivers of the loss of larger predators in human-modified landscapes. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","anthropogenic disturbance; carnivore; conservation; environmental filter; human footprint index; human-wildlife coexistence; occupancy; traits; ungulate; wildlife","anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; carnivore; disturbance; ecosystem response; human activity; land use change; landscape change; life history; mammal; ungulate; wildlife management; North America; Mammalia; Ungulata; animal; ecosystem; human; human activities; life history trait; mammal; North America; wild animal; Animals; Animals, Wild; Ecosystem; Human Activities; Humans; Life History Traits; Mammals; North America","Anton, C.B., Smith, D.W., Suraci, J.P., Stahler, D.R., Duane, T.P., Wilmers, C.C., Gray wolf habitat use in response to visitor activity along roadways in Yellowstone National Park (2020) Ecosphere, 11 (6). , https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.3164; Aronson, M.F.J., Nilon, C.H., Lepczyk, C.A., Parker, T.S., Warren, P.S., Cilliers, S.S., Goddard, M.A., Zipperer, W., Hierarchical filters determine community assembly of urban species pools (2016) Ecology, 97 (11), pp. 2952-2963. , https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.1535; Bateman, P.W., Fleming, P.A., Big city life: Carnivores in urban environments (2012) Journal of Zoology, 287 (1), pp. 1-23. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2011.00887.x; Bateman, P.W., Fleming, P.A., Are negative effects of tourist activities on wildlife over-reported?

However, the quality of this information is frequently debated within the scientific community. Modern citizen science implementations therefore require measures of the users' proficiency. We introduce a new methodological framework of item response that quantifies a citizen scientist's ability, taking into account the difficulty of the task. We focus on citizen science programs involving the classification of images. Our approach accommodates spatial autocorrelation within the item difficulties, and provides deeper insights and relevant ecological measures of species and site-related difficulties, discriminatory power and guessing behaviour. The identification of very capable versus less skilled participants can facilitate selective use of data in analyses and more targeted training programs for citizen scientists. This paper also addresses challenges in fitting such models to very large datasets. We found that the suggested methods outperform the traditional item response models in terms of RMSE, accuracy and WAIC, based on leave-one-out cross-validation on simulated and empirical data. We present a comprehensive implementation using a case study of species identification in the Serengeti, Tanzania. The R and Stan codes are provided for full reproducibility. Multiple statistical illustrations and visualizations are given, which allow extrapolation to a wide range of citizen science ecological problems. © 2021 The Authors.

The shorter-term diel vertical migration (DVM) has a periodicity of up to 1 day and was first described by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1817. In 1888, the German marine biologist Carl Chun described the longer-term seasonal vertical migration (SVM), which has a periodicity of ca. 1 year. The proximate control and adaptive significance of DVM have been extensively studied and are well understood. DVM is generally a behaviour controlled by ambient irradiance, which allows herbivorous zooplankton to feed in food-rich shallower waters during the night when light-dependent (visual) predation risk is minimal and take refuge in deeper, darker waters during daytime. However, DVMs of herbivorous zooplankton are followed by their predators, producing complex predator–prey patterns that may be traced across multiple trophic levels. In contrast to DVM, SVM research is relatively young and its causes and consequences are less well understood. During periods of seasonal environmental deterioration, SVM allows zooplankton to evacuate shallower waters seasonally and take refuge in deeper waters often in a state of dormancy. Both DVM and SVM play a significant role in the vertical transport of organic carbon to deeper waters (biological carbon sequestration), and hence in the buffering of global climate change. Although many animal migrations are expected to change under future climate scenarios, little is known about the potential implications of global climate change on zooplankton vertical migrations and its impact on the biological carbon sequestration process. Further, the combined influence of DVM and SVM in determining zooplankton fitness and maintenance of their horizontal (geographic) distributions is not well understood. The contrasting spatial (deep versus shallow) and temporal (diel versus seasonal) scales over which these two migrations occur lead to challenges in studying them at higher spatial, temporal and biological resolution and coverage. Extending the largely population-based vertical migration knowledge base to individual-based studies will be an important way forward. While tracking individual zooplankton in their natural habitats remains a major challenge, conducting trophic-scale, high-resolution, year-round studies that utilise emerging field sampling and observation techniques, molecular genetic tools and computational hardware and software will be the best solution to improve our understanding of zooplankton vertical migrations. © 2021 The Authors.

Invasive wild pigs (Sus scrofa) have been reported in Ontario, Canada. We compared trends in reporting frequency of wild pig sightings to trends in media events that included directions for the public on where to submit their wild pig sightings. We found that media events occurring on the same week, and in up to two weeks before the sighting was reported significantly increased the number of wild pig reports we received. Our findings suggest that media can be used to increase participation by the public. Because of this relationship, our findings also imply that reporting frequency alone cannot accurately index real changes in wild pig numbers—participants were more likely to report sightings after they had been exposed to relevant media, and spikes in the number of reports tracked our outreach efforts. Despite this limitation, reports of wild pig sightings from community members remain a cost-effective tool to detect low-density invasive species across large regions, and participation in the program can be increased with periodic news media and social media blitzes. © 2021, Crown.","Canada; Citizen science; Ontario; Social media; Sus scrofa; Wild pig","crowdsourcing; detection method; invasive species; monitoring system; pig; social media; wild population; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Elliptio dilatata; Sus scrofa","Aschim, R.A., Brook, R.K., Evaluating cost-effective methods for rapid and repeatable national scale detection and mapping of invasive species spread (2019) Sci Rep, 9 (1), pp. 1-13; Barrios-Garcia, M.N., Ballari, S.A., Impact of wild boar (Sus scrofa) in its introduced and native range: a review (2012) Biol Invasions, 14 (11), pp. 2283-2300; Beasley, J.C., Ditchkoff, S.S., Mayer, J.J., Smith, M.D., Vercauteren, K.C., Research priorities for managing invasive wild pigs in North America (2018) J Wildl Manage, 82 (4), pp. 674-681; Bevins, S.N., Pedersen, K., Lutman, M.W., Gidlewski, T., Deliberto, T.J., Consequences associated with the recent range expansion of nonnative feral swine (2014) Bioscience, 64 (4), pp. 291-299; Brook, R.K., van Beest, F.M., Feral wild boar distribution and perceptions of risk on the central Canadian prairies (2014) Wildl Soc Bull, 38 (3), pp. 486-494; Caudell, J.N., McCann, B.E., Newman, R.A., Simmons, R.B., Backs, S.E., Schmit, B.S., Sweitzer, R.A., Identification of putative origins of introduced pigs in Indiana using nuclear microsatellite markers and oral history (2013) Proceedings of the 15Th Wildlife Damage Management Conference, pp. 39-41. , Armstrong JB, Gallagher GR; Centner, T.J., Shuman, R.M., Governmental provisions to manage and eradicate feral swine in areas of the United States (2015) Ambio, 44 (2), pp. 121-130; Wild Pig Reproductive Biology (2009) Wild Pigs: Biology, Damage, Control Techniques and Management.

This article reviews the intersection of these two trends. First, we review how AI has become integrated into existing climate knowledge infrastructures and decision-making systems. Second, we review how AI is reshaping decision-making processes in the face of climate change, focusing on the governance of changing biological systems. AI is transforming data collection and classification, conservation decision-making, and rule enforcement. A crucial theme is the changing temporality of environmental governance. We emphasize automated data collection and classification, dynamic optimization and predictive enforcement. Third, we turn to emergent problems in the ethics and politics of algorithmic conservation. AI's increasingly prevalent role in conservation has the potential to introduce ethical dilemmas, redistribute power among stakeholders, and enable the emergence of new objects of knowledge and political struggles. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","","artificial intelligence; climate change; conservation status; decision making; governance approach; indigenous knowledge; knowledge; optimization","Cugurullo, F., Urban artificial intelligence: from automation to autonomy in the smart city (2020) Front Sustain Cities, 2, p. 38; Edwards, P.N., A Vast Machine: Computer Models, Climate Data, and the Politics of Global Warming (2010), Mit Press; O'Gorman, P.A., Dwyer, J.G., Using machine learning to parameterize moist convection: potential for modeling of climate, climate change, and extreme events (2018) J Adv Model Earth Syst, 10, pp. 2548-2563; Rasp, S., Pritchard, M.S., Gentine, P., Deep learning to represent subgrid processes in climate models (2018) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 115, pp. 9684-9689; Huntingford, C., Machine learning and artificial intelligence to aid climate change research and preparedness (2019) Environ Res Lett, 14; Liu, Y., Application of deep convolutional neural networks for detecting extreme weather in climate datasets (2016) arXiv preprint; Scher, S., Messori, G., Predicting weather forecast uncertainty with machine learning (2018) Q J R Meteorol Soc, 144, pp. 2830-2841; Jones, N., Can artificial intelligence help build better, smarter climate models?

Flexible, efficient, and effective monitoring and enforcement methods are needed to help conservation policies realize their full benefit. As remote sensing data become more numerous and accessible, they can be used to identify and quantify land-cover changes and habitat loss. However, these data remain underused for systematic conservation monitoring in part because of a lack of simple tools. We adapted 2 algorithms that automatically identify differences between pairs of images. We used free, publicly available satellite data to evaluate their ability to rapidly detect land-cover changes in a variety of land-cover types. We compared algorithm predictions with ground-truthed results at 100 sites of known change in the United States. We also compared algorithm predictions to manually created polygons delineating anthropogenic change in 4 case studies involving imperiled species’ habitat: oil and gas development in the range of the Greater Sage Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus); sand mining operations in the range of the dunes sagebrush lizard (Sceloporus arenicolus); loss of Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) coastal habitat after Hurricane Michael (2018); and residential development in St. Andrew beach mouse (Peromyscus polionotus peninsularis) habitat. Both algorithms effectively discriminated between pixels corresponding to land-cover change and unchanged pixels as indicated by area under a receiver operating characteristic curve >0.90. The algorithm that was most effective differed among the case-study habitat types, and both effectively delineated habitat loss as indicated by low omission (min. = 0.0) and commission (min. = 0.0) rates, and moderate polygon overlap (max. = 47%). Our results showed how these algorithms can be used to help close the implementation gap of monitoring and enforcement in biodiversity conservation. We provide a free online tool that can be used to run these analyses (https://conservationist.io/habitatpatrol). © 2021 Society for Conservation Biology","cambio en la cobertura del suelo; Endangered Species Act; especies amenazadas; inventario y monitoreo; inventory and monitoring; land-cover change; Ley de Especies en Peligro; politics and policy; políticas y normas; remote sensing; telemetría; threatened species","biodiversity; conservation status; detection method; habitat conservation; habitat loss; residential development; satellite data; spatiotemporal analysis; wader; United States; Centrocercus urophasianus; Charadrius melodus; Peromyscus polionotus peninsularis; Sceloporus arenicolus; animal; biodiversity; Charadriiformes; ecosystem; environmental protection; mouse; search engine; Animals; Biodiversity; Charadriiformes; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Mice; Search Engine","Chandra, A., Idrisova, A., Convention on Biological Diversity: a review of national challenges and opportunities for implementation (2011) Biodiversity and Conservation, 20, pp. 3295-3316; Chapron, G., The environment needs cryptogovernance (2017) Nature, 545, pp. 403-405; Drusch, M., Sentinel-2: ESA's optical high-resolution mission for GMES operational services (2012) Remote Sensing of Environment, 120, pp. 25-36; Farr, T.G., The shuttle radar topography mission (2007) Reviews of Geophysics, 45; Fry, J.A., Xian, G., Jin, S., Dewitz, J.A., Homer, C.G., Limin, Y., Barnes, C.A., Wickham, J.D., Completion of the 2006 national land cover database for the conterminous United States (2011) Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing, 77, pp. 858-864; Ghorbanzadeh, O., Evaluation of different machine learning methods and deep-learning convolutional neural networks for landslide detection (2019) Remote Sensing, 11, p. 196; Gorelick, N., Hancher, M., Dixon, M., Ilyushchenko, S., Thau, D., Moore, R., Google Earth Engine: planetary-scale geospatial analysis for everyone (2017) Remote Sensing of Environment, 202, pp. 18-27; (2009) Endangered Species Act: the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has incomplete information about effects on listed species from section 7 consultations, , GAO, Washington, D.C; Hansen, M.C., Stehman, S.V., Potapov, P.V., Quantification of global gross forest cover loss (2010) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 107, pp. 8650-8655; Hossain, A.N.M., Barlow, A., Barlow, C.G., Lynam, A.J., Chakma, S., Savini, T., Assessing the efficacy of camera trapping as a tool for increasing detection rates of wildlife crime in tropical protected areas (2016) Biological Conservation, 201, pp. 314-319; Hussey, N.E., Aquatic animal telemetry: a panoramic window into the underwater world (2015) Science, 348; Jackman, S., (2017) pscl: classes and methods for R developed in the Political Science Computational laboratory, , United States Studies Centre, University of Sydney, Sydney; (1972) Nature conservation law, , http://extwprlegs1.fao.org/docs/pdf/jap95113.pdf, Law 85.

Using the internet to quantify the scale of the wildlife trade (volume and frequency) is a relatively recent and rapidly developing approach that lacks an accessible framework for locating relevant websites and collecting data. We produced an accessible guide for internet-based wildlife trade surveillance. We detailed a repeatable method involving a systematic internet search, with search engines, to locate relevant websites and content. For data collection, we highlight web-scraping technology as an efficient way to collect data in an automated fashion at regularly timed intervals. Our guide is applicable to the multitude of trade-based contexts because researchers can tailor search keywords for specific taxa or derived products and locations of interest. We provide information for working with the diversity of websites used in wildlife trade. For example, to locate relevant content on social media (e.g., posts or groups), each social media platform should be examined individually via the site's internal search engine. A key advantage of using the internet to study wildlife trade is the relative ease of access to an increasing amount of trade-related data. However, not all wildlife trade occurs online and it may occur on unobservable sections of the internet. © 2020 Society for Conservation Biology.","big data; comercio en línea; dark web; deep web; e-commerce; macrodatos; mercado de mascotas; pet trade; redes sociales; social media; surface web; web oscura; web profunda; web scraping; web scraping; web superficial","electronic commerce; Internet; law enforcement; social media; wildlife management; Varanidae; animal; commercial phenomena; environmental protection; human; information processing; Internet; social media; wild animal; Animals; Animals, Wild; Commerce; Conservation of Natural Resources; Data Collection; Humans; Internet; Social Media","Alfino, S., Roberts, D.L., Code word usage in the online ivory trade across four European Union member states (2018) Oryx, 54, pp. 494-498; Bergman, M.K., White paper: the deep web: surfacing hidden value (2001) Journal of Electronic Publishing, 7. , https://doi.org/10.3998/3336451.0007.104; Cassey, P., Delean, S., Lockwood, J.L., Sadowski, J.S., Blackburn, T.M., Dissecting the null model for biological invasions: a meta-analysis of the propagule pressure effect (2018) PLOS Biology, , https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2005987; Chamberlain, S., Szocs, E., Taxize: taxonomic search and retrieval in R (2013) F1000Research, 2, p. 191; Chen, H., (2011) Dark web: exploring and data mining the dark side of the web, , Springer-Verlag, New York; (2017) Dark web.

Cuvier, 1825) is a tremarctine bear commonly known as the Andean bear. It is a medium-sized bear with black to dark red-brown pelage with dense, long, coarse fur; creamy white marks occur on the chin, neck, and chest, and often white to creamy marks occur on the face, around the muzzle, and eyes. It is distributed in the tropical Andes of Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Perú, Bolivia, and northern Argentina in South America. T. ornatus is catalogued as ""Vulnerable""(VU) by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources and is included in CITES Appendix I. Main threats include habitat loss and fragmentation, illegal killing, human-bear conflicts, and most likely climate change. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Therefore, in this study, we present a comprehensive summary of selected classifiers operating on both exact and fuzzy numbers. The results of performance of specific classifiers are compared on the example of a unique set of empirical data on changes in the behavior of animals in response to environmental factors. This is one of the key challenges in ecological research and it is strictly related to ecosystem changes caused by climate change. Nowadays, changes in behavior are a very popular topic of research because as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and lower activity of people (lockdown effect). Therefore, various unusual reactions of wild animals were found around the world. A detailed compilation of research results, shortcomings, and strengths of various classification methods may be a compendium of knowledge for biologists and other practitioners as well as researchers working with empirical data. © 2021 IEEE.","behavioral traits; classification; ecological data; empirical data classification; fuzzy classifiers; fuzzy numbers","Animals; Behavioral research; Climate change; Ecology; Fuzzy sets; Biological science; Classification methods; Complex Processes; Comprehensive analysis; Ecological data; Ecosystem changes; Environmental factors; Research results; Classification (of information)","Goldbaum, M.H., Sample, P.A., Chan, K., Williams, J., Lee, T.-W., Blumenthal, E., Girkin, C.A., Weinreb, R.N., Comparing machine learning classifiers for diagnosing glaucoma from standard automated perimetry (2002) Invest.

The concept of integration is well-understood, but its practice across programs and studies can be diverse suggesting a broader examination of the existing general approaches is needed. From the literature, we suggest integration of monitoring can occur across three study components: interpretation, analysis, and design. Design can be further subdivided into partial and full integration. Respectively combining information, data, and designs, we further define these types of integration and describe their general benefits and challenges, such as strength of inference. We further use the Oil Sands Monitoring program in northern Alberta as an example to clarify the practices common among integrated monitoring programs. The goal of the discussion paper is to familiarize readers with the diverse practices of integrated monitoring to further clarify the various configurations used to achieve the wider goals of a program. © Copyright © 2021 Arciszewski, Roberts, Munkittrick and Scrimgeour.","environmental managemenent; environmental monitoring; integrated monitoring; oil sands; regional monitoring program","","Addison, P.F.E., Cook, C.N., de Bie, K., Conservation Practitioners' Perspectives on Decision Triggers for Evidence-Based Management (2016) J.

Leak detection and repair (LDAR) programs using optical gas imaging (OGI)-based surveys are routinely used to mitigate fugitive emissions or leaks. Recently, new technologies and platforms such as planes, drones, and satellites promise more cost-effective mitigation than existing approaches. To be approved for use in LDAR programs, new technologies must demonstrate emissions mitigation equivalent to existing approaches. In this work, we use the FEAST modeling tool to (a) identify cost vs mitigation trade-offs that arise from using new technologies and (b) provide a framework for effective design of alternative LDAR programs. We identify several critical insights. First, LDAR programs can trade sensitivity for speed without sacrificing mitigation outcomes. Second, low sensitivity or high detection threshold technologies have an effective upper bound on achievable mitigation that is independent of the survey frequency. Third, the cost effectiveness of tiered LDAR programs using site-level detection technologies depends on their ability to distinguish leaks from routine venting. Finally, ""technology equivalence""based on mitigation outcomes differs across basins and should be evaluated independently. The FEAST model will enable operators and regulators to systematically evaluate new technologies in next-generation LDAR programs. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","equivalence; FEAST; leak detection and repair; methane emissions; methane policy; new technologies","Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Economic and social effects; Leak detection; Methane; Surveys; Central component; Detection threshold; Emissions mitigation; Fugitive emissions; Leak detection and repair; Level detections; Methane emissions; Optical gas imaging; Gas emissions; methane; oil; methane; cost analysis; energy policy; environmental policy; imaging method; methane; satellite data; trade-off; air pollution; analytic method; Article; cost effectiveness analysis; environmental policy; feast model; leak detection and repair program; limit of detection; machine learning; process optimization; quantitative analysis; simulation; environmental monitoring; policy; Satellites; Environmental Monitoring; Methane; Policy","(2020) Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2018, Apr. 2020, , https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

This change in vertical structuring of native open vegetation may create hunting cover for predators. Therefore, animal species naturally dependent on open habitats, enabling effective visual scanning of their environment, may need to adapt to a denser vegetation structure to survive. Hence, we expected a negative consequence of increasing WPE intensity in the grasslands of the Bolivian Gran Chaco, on the population of guanacos (Lama guanicoe) at the species’ northerly distribution limit. We analysed guanaco alert responses under different conditions, whether the animals: 1) modified their response according to habitat structure; 2) varied their escape response according to their group size and composition; and 3) responded differently to observers (these approaching either on foot or horseback). The habitat variable (open versus dense) was the strongest predictor of an alert response, irrespective of whether guanacos were alone or in groups. Contrary to our expectation, guanacos were more alert when in open habitat. In addition, we found no evidence for the effect of habitat type on group size. Finally, there was a significant association between observation method and guanaco alert response. We suggest that the current combination of relatively high densities of predators such as puma (Puma concolor), and jaguar (Panthera onca) together with WPE-driven replacement of natural, open habitat preferred by Chacoan guanacos, could diminish the potential recovery and survival of this population of guanacos, currently threatened in Bolivia. © SAREM, 2021.","Camelidae; Change in vegetation structure; Conservation; Gran Chaco","","ACEbES, P., TRAbA, J., MALO, J.

Despite being frequently used, the standardization of this method is problematic due to the large range of combinations of the individual parameters of pitfall traps with varying efficacy under different environmental conditions. We evaluated the effects of the trap diameter, the fixing fluid, and their combination on the capture efficacy for harvestmen (Opiliones) and millipedes (Diplopoda). We used pitfall traps with three different diameters: 3 cm, 5 cm, and 12 cm, filled with three types of fixing fluids (saturated fluid of NaCl, 10:1 mixture of 70% ethanol and glycerol and 4% formaldehyde). Altogether, 90 traps representing nine combinations of trap diameters and fixing fluid were placed on a mown meadow in spring and autumn intervals for a total of 45 days. We sampled 1,488 individuals representing 11 harvestmen species and 881 individuals representing 11 millipede species. Large (d = 12 cm) and medium (5 cm) traps captured significantly more millipede species and individuals than the small-sized traps (3 cm). The same effect was observed for harvestmen species richness, whereas the medium traps (d = 5 cm) captured the highest mean activity of harvestmen. By analyzing the differences in the body sizes of the studied arthropods in relation to the trap diameter and fluid, we found that larger traps, as well as traps filled with NaCl solution, captured larger harvestmen more frequently than the other trap types. Our results revealed that the combination of larger traps (d = 5 and 12 cm) and formaldehyde was most effective in the capture of both studied groups. However, the disadvantage of formaldehyde is its toxicity. © 2021 The Authors.

According to the IUCN Red List, many recorded species in this region are listed as threatened or endangered. Despite all threats, better management and more investments in species monitoring would surely improve the efficiency of biodiversity conservation projects to protect Mediterranean forest mammals. Protected reserves are of utmost importance for the conservation of native flora and fauna. Hereby, we provide a survey of mammals through a noninvasive technique based on environmental DNA extracted from scats. Samples were collected over 1 year covering all seasons from an important site for biodiversity conservation and scientific researches, the Horsh Ehden Nature Reserve. A total of 18 vertebrate species were recorded, many of them are endemic for the region and/or threatened especially in Lebanon. The use of noninvasive sampling method combined with genetic analysis of scats proved to be a powerful tool for species detection in a highly biodiverse protected area and can be easily replicated in any region around the world to rapidly assess species richness and therefore to apply direct conservation and management strategies toward species of interest. © 2021 The Authors.

We assume that a seasonal variation in the diel activity would support the notion that both rhythms may assist in achieving a quick and flexible response when the climatic conditions change. Data coming from 4,104 pitfall traps placed during 15 sampling periods and totalling 30 daily sampling cycles were analysed using circular statistics and General Linear Models. A wide variety of seasonal patterns are observed, highlighting those species with a clear unimodal or spring-autumn bimodal seasonal pattern. However, a midday diel pattern is the norm in most of the species, except in the case of those exhibiting a high body weight that prefer dusk or night periods. We hypothesize that most of the dung beetle species fly at noon to promote the passive heating of their muscle activity and minimize the metabolic energy expenditure. Results only partially support the seasonal variation in diel activity. Diel preferences are mainly manifested at the time of the year in which the abundance is greater. Approximately two-thirds of the considered species exhibit a similar diel activity along their seasonal active period. As consequence, a significant portion of the dung beetle species currently inhabiting Mediterranean mid-mountains are not able to use the daily variation in climatic conditions to limit the inconveniences of climate change.

Although our general knowledge of reproductive physiology is improving, it appears that the application of assisted reproductive technology (ART) will more efficiently advance wildlife conservation efforts and preserve genetic diversity. The purpose of this review is to present the most important results obtained with the use of ART in Neotropical deer. Thus, the state-of-the-art for estrus synchronization, semen technology, artificial insemination, and in vivo embryo production will be presented. In vitro embryo production (IVP) is also a biotechnology that is taking initial steps in deer. In this aspect, the approach with the proteomics of ovarian follicular fluid is being used as a tool for a better understanding of oocyte maturation. Finally, cell banks and the use of interspecific somatic cell nuclear transfer (iSCNT) as well as the use of stem cells for gametes differentiation are promising techniques. © 2021 by the authors.

In the case of wolves, it is known that vo-calisations in response to unfamiliar howls are issued to defend their territory and the important resources within it. Then, we studied the characteristics of winter response sites (WRS) during the cold season, aiming to assess their eventual ability to provide insights into the distribution of valuable resources within their territories. Within this scope, we planned a wolf-howling survey following a standardised approach. The study covered an Apennine (Central Italy) area of 500 km2 . A hexagonal mesh was imposed on the area, in order to determine the values of different variables at the local scale. A logistic LASSO regression was performed. WRS were positively related to the presence of thermal refuges (odds = 114.485), to patch richness (odds = 1.153), wild boar drive hunting areas (odds = 1.015), and time elapsed since the last hunt (odds = 1.019). Among negative factors, stray dogs reply considerably affects wolves’ responsiveness (odds = 0.207), where odds are the exponentiated coefficients estimated by the logistic lasso regression. These results suggest that WRS are related to anthropogenic and environmental factors favouring the predation process. © 2021 by the authors.

In omnibus surveys that record data on multiple species simultaneously, species ranges are often nonoverlapping and misaligned with the administrative unit defining the spatial domain of interest (e.g., a state or province). Consequently, some species display differentially restricted extents within a study area. Assuming hard boundaries based on expert opinion or published range maps to restrict species occurrence predictions implies a false sense of certainty in model-based inferences. We propose a multi-species occupancy model with a spatial Gaussian process on site-specific effects for each species as a model-based solution. Specifying informative Bayesian hyperpriors on the spatial hyperparameters encapsulates broad-scale correlation among site occupancy probabilities for each species. We fit this model to acoustic detection/nondetection data collected with autonomous recording units during summer of 2016–2019 throughout Oregon and Washington, USA, on 15 bat species. We found vast improvements in spatial predictions of spotted bat (Euderma maculatum), canyon bat (Parastrellus hesperus), and Brazilian free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis) when the available environmental predictors were insufficient for characterizing their restricted ranges within the region. In contrast, widespread species (Lasionycteris noctivagans, Myotis californicus, Myotis evotis, Myotis volans) were appropriately modeled using only environmental predictors, such as percentage forest cover and cliff and canyon cover. Utilizing spatial Gaussian processes within a community or multi-species model incorporates uncertainty in range boundaries and allows for simultaneous predictions for the entire faunal assemblage even if species have nonoverlapping or restricted ranges within a spatial domain of interest. Such modeling improvements are essential if species distribution models are to accurately inform monitoring, species recovery plans, and other conservation efforts. © 2021 The Authors.

Here we synthesize the biogeography of key organisms (vascular and nonvascular vegetation and soil microorganisms), attributes (functional traits, spatial patterns, plant–plant and plant–soil interactions) and processes (productivity and land cover) across global drylands. These areas have a long evolutionary history, are centers of diversification for many plant lineages and include important plant diversity hotspots. This diversity captures a strikingly high portion of the variation in leaf functional diversity observed globally. Part of this functional diversity is associated with the large variation in response and effect traits in the shrubs encroaching dryland grasslands. Aridity and its interplay with the traits of interacting plant species largely shape biogeographical patterns in plant–plant and plant–soil interactions, and in plant spatial patterns. Aridity also drives the composition of biocrust communities and vegetation productivity, which shows large geographical variation. We finish our review by discussing major research gaps, which include: studying regular vegetation spatial patterns; establishing large-scale plant and biocrust field surveys assessing individual-level trait measurements; knowing whether the impacts of plant–plant and plant–soil interactions on biodiversity are predictable; and assessing how elevated CO2 modulates future aridity conditions and plant productivity. © 2021 The Authors New Phytologist © 2021 New Phytologist Foundation","biological soil crusts; diversity; functional traits; macroecology; plant–plant interactions; plant–soil interactions; spatial pattern; woody encroachment","aridity; biodiversity; biogeography; carbon dioxide; dryland farming; geodiversity; soil-vegetation interaction; species diversity; biodiversity; ecosystem; geography; plant; soil; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Geography; Plants; Soil","Aguiar, M.R., Sala, O.E., Patch structure, dynamics and implications for the functioning of arid ecosystems (1999) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 14, pp. 273-277; Ahlstrom, A., Raupach, M.R., Schurgers, G., Smith, B., Arneth, A., Jung, M., Reichstein, M., Jain, A.K., The dominant role of semi-arid ecosystems in the trend and variability of the land CO2 sink (2015) Science, 348, pp. 895-899; Al Hayek, P., Maalouf, J.P., Baumel, A., Dagher-Kharrat, M.B., Médail, F., Touzard, B., Michalet, R., Differential effects of contrasting phenotypes of a foundation legume shrub drive plant–plant interactions in a Mediterranean mountain (2015) Journal of Vegetation Science, 26, pp. 373-384; Allington, G.R.H., Valone, T.J., Islands of fertility: a byproduct of grazing?

Joint species distribution models (JSDMs) have emerged as a promising statistical framework towards this objective by simultaneously modelling the environmental responses of multiple species and approximating species associations based on patterns in their (co-)occurrences. However, the signature of biotic interactions should be most evident at fine spatial resolutions. Here, we test how the resolution of input data affects the inferences from JSDMs. Location: Switzerland. Taxon: Birds. Methods: Using standardized survey data of 43 woodland bird species and 8 climatic, topographic and vegetation structural predictors, we fit JSDMs at different spatial resolutions (125–1000 m) and sampling periods (1 and 5 years). In addition, we calculate functional similarity among all species as an independent proxy of biotic interactions, specifically competition. We then assess how JSDM performance and estimates vary with the spatial resolution of the input data and test whether species associations are consistent across grain sizes and with the alternative approach based on functional similarity. Results: Our results show better model performance at coarser spatial resolutions and for longer sampling periods. Although pairwise species associations estimated in JSDMs were generally shifted towards positive values, we found a higher proportion of negative associations at fine spatial resolutions. Strikingly, estimates were not consistent across spatial scales and frequently switched between positive and negative values. Moreover, estimated species associations tended to be more positive for functionally similar species. Main conclusions: Our results show that species associations are more differentiated, that is, cover a broader range of values, at finer spatial resolutions. Yet, their positive correlation with functional similarity and the general over-representation of positive associations suggest that shared responses to unobserved environmental predictors rather than biotic interactions underlie these scaling effects, cautioning against a naive interpretation of species associations estimated by JSDMs at any spatial scale. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","biotic interactions; birds; community assembly; hierarchical modelling; JSDM; spatial scaling","biogeography; biotic factor; bird; ecological modeling; environmental factor; spatial resolution; Switzerland","Araújo, M.B., Luoto, M., The importance of biotic interactions for modelling species distributions under climate change (2007) Global Ecology and Biogeography, 16 (6), pp. 743-753. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00359.x; Araújo, M.B., Rozenfeld, A., The geographic scaling of biotic interactions (2014) Ecography, 37 (5), pp. 406-415. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.00643.x; Barner, A.K., Coblentz, K.E., Hacker, S.D., Menge, B.A., Fundamental contradictions among observational and experimental estimates of non-trophic species interactions (2018) Ecology, 99 (3), pp. 557-566. , https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2133; Blanchet, F.G., Cazelles, K., Gravel, D., Co-occurrence is not evidence of ecological interactions (2020) Ecology Letters, 23 (7), pp. 1050-1063. , https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.13525; Box, E.O., Predicting physiognomic vegetation types with climate variables (1981) Vegetatio, 45 (2), pp. 127-139. , https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00119222; Brown, J.H., (1995) Macroecology, , University of Chicago Press; Brown, J.L., Orians, G.H., Spacing patterns in mobile animals (1970) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 1 (1), pp. 239-262; Chase, J.M., Spatial scale resolves the niche versus neutral theory debate (2014) Journal of Vegetation Science, 25 (2), pp. 319-322. , https://doi.org/10.1111/jvs.12159; Chase, J.M., Myers, J.A., Disentangling the importance of ecological niches from stochastic processes across scales (2011) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 366 (1576), pp. 2351-2363. , https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2011.0063; Chen, J., Saunders, S.C., Crow, T.R., Naiman, R.J., Brosofske, K.D., Mroz, G.D., Brookshire, B.L., Franklin, J.F., Microclimate in forest ecosystem and landscape ecology (1999) BioScience, 49 (4), pp. 288-297. , https://doi.org/10.2307/1313612; Chust, G., Pretus, J.L., Ducrot, D., Ventura, D., Scale dependency of insect assemblages in response to landscape pattern (2004) Landscape Ecology, 19 (1), pp. 41-57. , https://doi.org/10.1023/B:LAND.0000018368.99833.f2; Clark, J.S., Gelfand, A.E., Woodall, C.W., Zhu, K., More than the sum of the parts: Forest climate response from joint species distribution models (2014) Ecological Applications, 24 (5), pp. 990-999. , https://doi.org/10.1890/13-1015.1; Darras, K., Batáry, P., Furnas, B.J., Grass, I., Mulyani, Y.A., Tscharntke, T., Autonomous sound recording outperforms human observation for sampling birds: A systematic map and user guide (2019) Ecological Applications, 29 (6). , https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.1954; Dhondt, A.A., (2012) Interspecific competition in birds, , Oxford University Press; Dormann, C.F., Bobrowski, M., Dehling, D.M., Harris, D.J., Hartig, F., Lischke, H., Moretti, M.D., Kraan, C., Biotic interactions in species distribution modelling: 10 questions to guide interpretation and avoid false conclusions (2018) Global Ecology and Biogeography, 27 (9), pp. 1004-1016. , https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.12759; Dormann, C.F., Elith, J., Bacher, S., Buchmann, C., Carl, G., Carré, G., Marquéz, J.R.G., Lautenbach, S., Collinearity: A review of methods to deal with it and a simulation study evaluating their performance (2013) Ecography, 36 (1), pp. 27-46. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2012.07348.x; Elton, C.S., (1927) Animal ecology, , University of Chicago Press; Franklin, J., Predictive vegetation mapping: Geographic modelling of biospatial patterns in relation to environmental gradients (1995) Progress in Physical Geography, 19 (4), pp. 474-499; Freilich, M.A., Wieters, E., Broitman, B.R., Marquet, P.A., Navarrete, S.A., Species co-occurrence networks: Can they reveal trophic and non-trophic interactions in ecological communities?

However, data from large reef systems commonly originate from multiple monitoring programs that use different methods, each with distinct biases that limit united assessments of ecological status. The effective integration of data from different monitoring methods would allow better assessment of system status and hence, more informed management. Here we examine the scope for comparability and complementarity of fish data from two different methods used on Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR): underwater visual census (UVC) and baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS). We compared commonly reported reef fish measures from UVC and BRUVS on similar reef slope habitats of three central GBR reefs. Both methods recorded similar estimates of total species richness, although ~30% of recorded species were not common to both methods. There were marked differences between methods in sub-group species richness, frequency of species occurrences, relative abundances of taxa and assemblage structure. The magnitude and orientation of inter-method differences were often inconsistent among taxa. However, each method better categorized certain components of fish communities: BRUVS sampled more predatory species in higher numbers while UVC was similarly better at sampling damselfishes (Pomacentridae). Our results suggest limited scope for direct or adjusted comparisons of data from UVC and BRUVS. Conversely, complementary aspects of the two methods confirm that their integration in monitoring programs will provide a more complete and extensive assessment of reef fish status for managers than from either method alone. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Baited remote underwater video stations; Complementarity; Great Barrier Reef; Management; Monitoring; Reef fish; Underwater visual census","coastal fishery; environmental monitoring; fishing community; predator-prey interaction; reef formation; species richness; underwater camera; videography; visual analysis; article; Australia; habitat; human; intermethod comparison; manager; species richness; videorecording; animal; biodiversity; coral reef; ecosystem; fish; population research; Australia; Coral Sea; Great Barrier Reef; Queensland; Pomacentridae; Animals; Biodiversity; Censuses; Coral Reefs; Ecosystem; Fishes","Andradi-Brown, D.A., Macaya-Solis, C., Exton, D.A., Gress, E., Wright, G., Rogers, A.D., Assessing Caribbean shallow and mesophotic reef fish communities using Baited-Remote Underwater Video (BRUV) and Diver-Operated Video (DOV) survey techniques (2016) PloS One, 11. , e0168235; Australian Government, Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan–July 2018 (2018), Commonwealth of Australia; Bacheler, N.M., Schobernd, Z.H., Gregalis, K.C., Schobernd, C.M., Teer, B.Z., Gillum, Z., Glasgow, D.M., Muñoz, R., Patterns in fish biodiversity associated with temperate reefs on the southeastern US continental shelf (2019) Mar.

A prevailing hypothesis is that abiotic stress forms cold (upper latitude/altitude) limits, whereas biotic interactions create warm (lower) limits. A new framework – Interactive Range-Limit Theory (iRLT) – asserts that positive biotic factors such as food availability can ameliorate abiotic stress along cold edges, whereas abiotic stress can have a positive effect and mediate biotic interactions (e.g., competition) along warm limits. Location: Northeastern United States. Taxon: Carnivora. Methods: We evaluated two hypotheses of iRLT using occupancy and structural equation modeling (SEM) frameworks based on data collected over a 6-year period (2014–2019) of six carnivore species across a broad latitudinal (42.8–45.3°N) and altitudinal (3–1451 m) gradient. Results: We found that snow directly limits populations, but prey or habitat availability can influence range dynamics along cold edges. For example, bobcats (Lynx rufus) and coyotes (Canis latrans) were limited by deep snow and long winters, but the availability of prey had a strong positive effect. Conversely, snow had a strong positive effect on the warm limits of Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis), countering the negative effect of competition with the phylogenetically similar bobcat and with coyotes, highlighting how climate mediates competition between species. Main conclusions: We used an integrated dataset that included competitors and prey species collected at the same spatial and temporal scale. As such, this design, along with a causal modeling framework (SEM), allowed us to evaluate community-wide hypotheses at macroecological scales and identify coarse-scale drivers of species' range limits. Our study supports iRLT and underscores the need to consider direct and indirect mechanisms for studying range dynamics and species' responses to global change. © 2021 The Authors.

It is causing changes to natural habitats and species composition. Urban green spaces have shown to have conservation value for native species by providing safe spaces in urban areas. They typically contain a variety of habitats and plant species which is correlated with greater abundance and diversity of small mammal species. Zoos are a vital resource for animal conservation and, in some instances, could be considered as an urban green space for native species conservation. Their unique environment provides free-living, native species an abundance of resources including food and shelter. This project involved the live trapping of free-living small mammal species (<40 g) between enclosures in Dudley Zoological Gardens to study the effects of the zoo environment. There were no significant differences found between the total number of captures and trap proximity to enclosures. There was a significant difference in total captures found between different enclosure trapping areas. Generalized linear mixed models were fitted to the data and there were significant relationships between abundance and both habitat type and enclosure species. Habitats associated with semi-natural woodland had the greatest diversity and total captures of small mammals. Total captures were lower in trapping areas that were associated with predatory species. Similar to research on green spaces, habitat was an important factor determining abundance, but predator enclosures were a factor unique to zoos. This study illustrates the potential of zoos as an urban green space and for the study of small mammals. © 2021 The Authors.

This technique has several advantages and addresses many of the biases related to traditional field surveys. However, locating animal sounds using autonomous recording units (ARUs) can be technically challenging and therefore ARUs have traditionally been little employed to estimate animal density. Nonetheless, several approaches have been proposed in recent years to carry out acoustic-based bird density estimations. We conducted a literature review of studies that used ARUs for estimating bird densities or bird abundances in order to describe the applications and improve future monitoring programmes. We detected a growing interest in the use of ARUs for estimating bird density in the last 6 years (2014–19), with a total of 31 articles assessing the topic. The most common approach was to estimate the relationship between the number of vocalizations per recording time with bird density or bird abundance estimated in the field (61%). In 26 studies (79%), bird estimates obtained by human surveyors agreed with those obtained using ARUs. Some approaches have proven able to reduce biases in acoustic surveys, such as considering imperfect detection (spatially explicit capture–recapture, using microphone arrays), applying paired acoustic sampling to control for different sampling radius between humans and ARUs, or including relative sound level measurements that allow researchers to estimate bird distance to recorder. However, several studies did not include any covariates to reduce existing biases and some did not estimate the sampling radius of the recorder, which may hamper future comparisons between human and ARU surveys. Future studies should include a measurement of the sampling radius of the recorder employed to be able to obtain density estimations using ARUs. Finally, we provide some guidelines to improve the applicability of ARUs to infer bird population estimates in future studies. © 2021 British Ornithologists' Union","array; autonomous recording units; autonomous sound recorder; distance sampling; sonogram analyses; soundscape indices; vocal activity rate","abundance; bird; detection method; estimation method; future prospect; literature review; monitoring system; population density; survey method; wild population","Abrahams, C., Comparison between lek counts and bioacoustic recording for monitoring Western Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus L.)

These are important considerations for airport operators that are obliged to mitigate wildlife hazards at airfields. Incidents involving mammals account for approximately 3–10% of all recorded strikes. However, relatively little research has been conducted on mammal strikes with aircraft outside of the USA. We collate mammal strike data from six major national aviation authorities and a global aircraft database and review the available scientific and grey literature. We aim to identify which mammal families are involved in strike events and how widespread the issue is on a global scale. We also aim to demonstrate the importance of consistently recording strike instances in national databases. We identified 40 families that were involved in strike events in 47 countries. Reported mammal strike events have been increasing by up to 68% annually. Chiroptera (4 families) accounted for the greatest proportion of strikes in Australia; leporids and canids in Canada, Germany and the UK; and Chiroptera (5 families) and cervids in the USA. More mammals were struck during the landing phase of an aircraft's rotation than any other phase. Circa-diel strike risk was greatest at dusk and circa-annum strike risk was greatest during late summer, with some international variation. The total estimated cost of damage resulting from reported mammal strikes exceeded US$103 million in the USA alone, over 30 years. Mammal strikes represent a substantial risk in airfield environments. Monitoring of existing wild mammal populations is required to understand temporal trends in presence, abundance, and activity patterns and to inform management decisions. Increased and accurate reporting of strike events globally is needed to inform Wildlife Hazard Management Plans and support effective strike mitigation. © 2021 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","aircraft; airfields; human–wildlife conflict; mammal strikes; strike mitigation; wildlife management; wildlife strikes","aircraft; airport; collision; mammal; roadkill; transportation safety; wildlife management; United States; Cervidae; Chiroptera; Mammalia","(2014) Australian Aviation Wildlife Strike Statistics, 2004–2013, , Australian Government, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia; (2018) Wildlife Strikes, , https://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/2018/ar-2018-035/, Database Australian Transport Safety Bureau, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia; (2018) Aviation Occurrence Statistics, , Australian Transport Safety Bureau, Australian Government, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia; (2019) Fatalities and Destroyed Aircraft due to Wildlife Strikes, , https://www.avisure.com/about-us/fatalities-and-destroyed-aircraft-due-to-wildlife-strikes-1912-to-present/, Database; Ball, S., Thomas, T., Butler, F., Endoparasites of the endemic Irish hare Lepus timidus hibernicus (2020) Wildlife Biology, 3. , https://doi.org/10.2981/wlb.00717; Barras, S., Wright, S., Civil aircraft collisions with birds and other wildlife in Ohio, 1990–1999 (2002) Ohio Journal of Science, 102, pp. 2-7; Bates, D., Mächler, M., Bolker, B., Walker, S., Fitting linear mixed-effects models using lme4 (2015) Journal of Statistical Software, 67, p. 51; Belant, J., Washburn, B., DeVault, T., Understanding animal movements at and near airports (2013) Wildlife in Airport Environments: Preventing Animal-aircraft Collisions Through Science-based Management, pp. 129-138. , DeVault T, Blackwell B, Belant J, (eds), Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, Maryland, USA; Benjamini, Y., Hochberg, Y., Controlling the false discovery rate: a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing (1995) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, 57, pp. 289-300; Bennie, J., Duffy, J., Inger, R., Gaston, K., Biogeography of time partitioning in mammals (2014) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 111, pp. 13727-13732; Bergman, D., Breck, S., Bender, S., Dogs gone wild: feral dog damage in the United States (2009) Proceedings of the 13th WDM Conference, pp. 177-183. , Boulanger JR, (ed.), Saratoga Springs, USA; Biondi, K., Belant, J., Martin, J., DeVault, T., Wang, G., White-tailed deer incidents with U.S. civil aircraft (2011) Wildlife Society Bulletin, 35, pp. 303-309; Biondi, K., Belant, J., DeVault, T., Martin, J., Wang, G., Bat incidents with U.S. civil aircraft (2013) Acta Chiropterologica, 15, pp. 185-192; Biondi, K., Belant, J., Martin, J., DeVault, T., Wang, G., Integrating mammalian hazards with management at U.S. civil airports: a case study (2014) Human-Wildlife Interactions, 8, pp. 31-38; Birkhofer, K., Andersson, G., Bengtsson, J., Bommarco, R., Dänhardt, J., Ekbom, B., Relationships between multiple biodiversity components and ecosystem services along a landscape complexity gradient (2018) Biological Conservation, 218, pp. 247-253; (2008) Australian Aircraft Activity.

Seed predation by rodents may serve to slow the encroachment of woody plants in grasslands and savannas. Our goals for this study were to determine if rodents in an African savanna selectively removed seeds of an encroaching plant and if foraging activity was influenced by the local vegetation structure or by the landscape context. From trials with two species of seeds (encroacher = Dichrostachys cinerea, non-encroaching overstory tree = Senegalia nigrescens) at 64 seed stations, we recorded 1,065 foraging events by seven species of granivorous rodents. We found a strong positive relationship between rodent activity and the number of seeds removed during trials. Foraging events were dominated by rodent seed predators, with <10.6% of events involving a rodent with the potential for secondary dispersal. Rodents selectively removed the seeds of the encroaching species, removing 32.6% more D. cinerea seeds compared to S. nigrescens. Additionally, rodent activity and the number of seeds removed increased at sites with more grass biomass. Our results suggest a potential mechanistic role for rodents in mitigating the spread of woody plants in grass dominated savannas. © Copyright © 2021 Teman, Stevens, Monadjem, Fletcher, Austin and McCleery.","Dichrostachys cinerea; ecosystem service; Eswatini; foraging; Senegalia nigrescens","","Aganga, A.A., Motshewa, C.B., Nutritive value of urea molasses block containing acacia erubescens or Dichrostachys cinerea as natural protein sources (2007) J.

Sodium deficiency in the vegetation of inland tropical rainforest has caused the terrestrial mammals with plants-based diets to depend on both natural and artificial licks for sodium intake on a regular basis. Mineral licks help terrestrial mammals to maintain homeostasis of minerals and neutralize toxicities accumulated in their bodies. Presently, 56 species of terrestrial mammals are observed at the mineral licks in Malaysia, where ungulates remain as the main visitors of the local licks. However, arboreal primate, rodent, fruit-eating bat, and predator species can be detected at the given licks as well, because their respective visitation pattern can be affected by various explanatory variables. These variables are categorized into five major groups in this chapter, such as the 1) Anthropogenic disturbance; 2) Biophysiochemical properties; 3) Weather conditions 4) Species traits, and; 5) Surrounding habitat conditions, of the licks. This chapter manages to identify the complex interrelationships between the given explanatory variables in impacting the mammalian visitation patterns to mineral licks in Malaysia. Visitation patterns of terrestrial mammals to mineral licks are frequently investigated by researchers through seven different aspects, for both individual species and all species as a whole. These parameters are: 1) Diel activity pattern; 2) Species composition; 3) Group size; 4) Species diversity; 5) Relative abundance; 6) Visitation duration, and; 7) Visitation frequency of detected species. However, the research trend of this field of study focuses on employing explanatory variables that are frequently applied by researchers, thus the degrees of influences of many explanatory variables towards mammalian visitation pattern to the licks in Malaysia remain uncertain at this moment. Besides that, several variables with potential impacts on the given matter have been identified in this chapter as well. In other words, various opportunities remain available for future researchers to fill up research gaps, as highlighted in this chapter. © 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","And tropical forest; Malaysia; Mineral lick; Terrestrial mammal","","Ampeng, A., Shukor, M.N., Sahibin, A.R., Idris, W.M.R., Ahmad, S., Mohammad, H., Madeline, G.P., Md-Zain, B.M., Patterns of mineral lick use by Northwest Bornean Orangutans (Pongo Pygmaeus Pygmaeus) in the Lanjak Entimau Wildlife Sanctuary, Sarawak, Malaysia (2016) European Journal of Wildlife Research, 62, pp. 147-150. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s10344-015-0983-8; Ayotte, J.B., Parker, K.L., Gillingham, M.P., Use of natural licks by four species of ungulates in Northern British Columbia (2008) Journal of Mammalogy, 89 (4), pp. 1041-1050; Ayotte, J.B., Parker, K.L., Arocena, J.M., Gillingham, M.P., Chemical composition of lick soils: Functions of soil ingestion by four ungulate species (2006) Journal of Mammalogy, 87 (5), pp. 878-888; Bakri, M.A., Yusof, E., Jawing, A., Faizul, N.M., Rahim, M.R.A., Ilias, R., Salim, N., Kasim, M.R.M., The presence of wildlife species at artificial pasture and artificial salt licks at protected areas in Peninsular Malaysia (2018) Journal of Wildlife and Parks, 34, pp. 1-8; Bansa, L.A., Ahmad, A.H., Matsubayashi, H., Assemblage structure of palaeotropical frugivorous bats at mineral licks sites in Deramakot and Tangkulap Forest Reserve, Sabah (2018) Journal of Tropical Biology and Conservation, 15, pp. 121-137; Bashir Ali, Z., (2014) Wildlife Diversity near Natural Saltlicks in the Ulu Muda Forest Reserve, , Malaysia: WWF-Malaysia; Bernard, H., Joseph, N., Ahmad, A.H., Kee, S.-L., Nakabayashi, M., Nilus, R., Suis, M.A.F., Goh, C., An initial assessment on terrestrial mammal community in and around Sungai Rawog Conservation Area, Sandakan, Sabah (2019) Proceedings of the Seminar on Sungai Rawog Conservation Area Scientific Expedition Segaliud Lokan Forest Reserve (FMU19B), pp. 190-204. , February 21, 2019.

Alterations to the green space are a viable solution for reducing land surface temperature (LST), yet few studies provide specific guidance for landscape planning adapted to the different regions. This paper proposed and defined the landscape complexity and the threshold value of cooling effect (TVoE). Results find that: (1) GI provides a better cooling effect in the densely built-up area than the green belt; (2) GI with a simple form, aggregated configuration, and low patch density had a better cooling intensity; (3) In the densely built-up area, TVoE of the forest area is 4.5 ha, while in the green belt, TVoE of the forest and grassland area is 9 ha and 2.25 ha. These conclusions will help the planners to reduce LST effectively, and employ environmentally sustainable planning. © 2021 The Author(s).","Cooling effect; Environmental sustainability; Landscape composition; Landscape topography; Spatial configuration; The densely built-up area; The green belt; Urban cooling island","Atmospheric temperature; Cooling; Forestry; Landforms; Planning; Sustainable development; Built-up areas; Cooling effects; Environmental sustainability; Landscape composition; Landscape topography; Spatial configuration; The densely build-up area; The green belt; Urban cooling islands; Topography","Akbari, H., Kolokotsa, D., Three decades of urban heat islands and mitigation technologies research (2016) Energy and Buildings, 133, pp. 834-842. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.09.067; Augusto, B., Roebeling, P., Rafael, S., Ferreira, J., Ascenso, A., Bodilis, C., Short and medium- to long-term impacts of nature-based solutions on urban heat (2020) Sustainable Cities and Society, 57, p. 102122. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2020.102122; Bao, T., Li, X., Zhang, J., Zhang, Y., Tian, S., Assessing the distribution of urban green spaces and its anisotropic cooling distance on urban heat island pattern in Baotou, China (2016) ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 5 (2), p. 12. , https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi5020012; Bartesaghi Koc, C., Osmond, P., Peters, A., Evaluating the cooling effects of green infrastructure: A systematic review of methods, indicators and data sources (2018) Solar Energy, 166, pp. 486-508. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2018.03.008; Berardi, U., Ghaffarian Hoseini, A.

The success rate in the tropics has been lower than in temperate regions, triggering research and reviews. Environmental factors unique to the tropics (e.g., land crabs and year-round rodent breeding) have been associated with eradication failure. Operational factors have also been important, but these have not been comprehensively assessed. The environmental and operational factors using global cases where rodent eradication initially failed and subsequent attempts occurred were compared. It was determined whether operational factors explained the initial failures, whether operational improvements explained subsequent successes, and whether re-attempting eradication after failure was worthwhile. About 35 eradication attempts on 17 islands, each with 1–2 species from a total of 5 species (Mus musculus and 4 Rattus spp.) were identified. On 14 islands (82%), eradication was achieved on the second (86%) or third attempt (14%). On the remaining 3 islands, eradication was not achieved. Evidence of operational faults for all failed attempts was found (e.g., poor planning, low quality bait, and gaps during bait application). In some cases, operational faults were unequivocally the cause of failure, but in others, it was impossible to discriminate from confounding, environmental factors. Nonetheless, failures appeared to be mainly the result of not exposing all rodents to a lethal dose of toxin, violating a crucial eradication principle. This can cause operational failure on any temperate or tropical island. However, there may be less tolerance for errors such as gaps in bait coverage on tropical islands, mainly due to bait consumption by land crabs. The findings on factors leading to eradication success (e.g., expert reviewed plans, realistic funding and permits, high standard baiting operations) reflect current best practice recommendations.

Timber harvesting is an important tool in enhancing regeneration and maintaining forest health. It also has considerable potential to influence transmission dynamics of tick-borne pathogens, which are deeply embedded in the forest ecosystem. We conducted a 2-year study to test the hypotheses that recent timber harvesting impacts blacklegged tick density and infection prevalence in managed nonindustrial forests. We found that (1) recent harvesting reduces the presence of nymphal and density of adult blacklegged ticks, (2) recently harvested stands are characterized by understory microclimate conditions that may inhibit tick survival and host-seeking behavior, (3) capture rates of small mammal species frequently parasitized by immature ticks are lower in recently harvested stands compared to control stands with no recent harvest history. In addition, a 1-year pilot study suggests that harvesting does not affect nymphal infection prevalence. Collectively, our results demonstrate that forest structure and understory conditions may impact ticks and the pathogens they transmit via a range of mechanistic pathways, and moreover, active forest management may offer sustainable tools to inhibit entomological risk of exposure to tick-borne pathogens in the landscape. © 2021, EcoHealth Alliance.","Blacklegged tick;

The insectivorous bats of Madagascar are understudied in comparison to the rest of the island's fauna, and very little is known about their habitat use. Here, we used a remote bioacoustic surveying technique in a bat survey of the Sahamalaza-Îles Radama National Park, northwest Madagascar, to study constant frequency echolocating bats (Hipposideridae and Rhinonycteridae). We used two passive acoustic monitoring units to automatically record bat activity from dusk until dawn in a range of habitat types that are characteristic of the region. Analysis of call acoustic parameters revealed three distinct constant-frequency phonic types within the national park, which we identified as Commerson's leaf-nosed bat (Macronycteris commersoni), the red trident bat (Triaenops menamena) and an unknown phonic type of ca. 78 kHz. We found significant differences in the habitat usage of these three species, suggesting species-specific habitat preferences among Madagascar's bats. Our statistical analyses revealed significant differences between the acoustic echolocation calls of these three phonic types. The 78 kHz calls do not match any of the other constant frequency-calling bat species currently described for Madagascar, indicating either acoustic divergence among bat sub-populations or the possible existence of a new undescribed species. These results highlight the need for increased survey efforts to gain an understanding of species-specific geographic distributions and habitat usage among Malagasy bats and to disentangle their cryptic species complexes. © 2021 Museum and Institute of Zoology PAS.

The sub-Antarctic islands of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands are home to globally significant populations of seabirds and marine mammals. South Georgia hosts the largest breeding populations of Antarctic fur seals, southern elephant seals and king penguins as well as significant populations of wandering, black-browed and grey-headed albatross. The island also holds important populations of macaroni and gentoo penguins. The South Sandwich Islands host the world’s largest colony of chinstrap penguins in addition to major populations of Adélie and macaroni penguins. A marine protected area was created around these islands in 2012 but monitoring populations of marine predators remains a challenge, particularly as these species breed over large areas in remote and often inaccessible locations. During the 2019/20 austral summer, we trialled the use of an unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV; drone) to monitor populations of seals, penguins and albatross and here we report our initial findings, including considerations about the advantages and limitations of the methodology. Three extensive southern elephant seal breeding sites were surveyed with complete counts made around the peak pupping date, two of these sites were last surveyed 24 years ago. A total of nine islands, historically recorded as breeding sites for wandering albatross, were surveyed with 144 fledglings and 48 adults identified from the aerial imagery. The UAV was effective at surveying populations of penguins that nest on flat, open terrain, such as Adélie and chinstrap penguin colonies at the South Sandwich Islands, and an extensive king penguin colony on South Georgia, but proved ineffective for monitoring macaroni penguins nesting in tussock habitat on South Georgia as individuals were obscured or hidden by vegetation. Overall, we show that UAV surveys can allow regular and accurate monitoring of these important wildlife populations. © Copyright © 2021 Dickens, Hollyman, Hart, Clucas, Murphy, Poncet, Trathan and Collins.","drone; penguin; remote sensing; southern elephant seal; unoccupied aerial vehicle; wandering albatross","","Agnew, D., Review—The CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Programme (1997) Antarct.

These advances are especially ground-breaking for supporting management, restora-tion, and conservation of landscapes with limited field access and vulnerable ecological systems, particularly wetlands. This study presents a scoping review of the current status and emerging opportunities in wetland UAV applications, with particular emphasis on ecosystem management goals and remaining research, technology, and data needs to even better support these goals in the future. Using 122 case studies from 29 countries, we discuss which wetland monitoring and management objectives are most served by this rapidly developing technology, and what workflows were employed to analyze these data. This review showcases many ways in which UAVs may help reduce or replace logistically demanding field surveys and can help improve the efficiency of UAV-based workflows to support longer-term monitoring in the face of wetland environmental challenges and management constraints. We also highlight several emerging trends in applications, technology, and data and offer insights into future needs. © 2021 by the authors.

These ecological processes act at multiple spatial and temporal scales, generating scale-dependent effects on gene flow. In this study, we focused on bobcats (Lynx rufus), a highly mobile, generalist felid that exhibits ecological and behavioral plasticity, high abundance, and broad connectivity across much of their range. However, bobcats also show genetic differentiation along habitat breaks, a pattern typically observed in cases of isolation-by-ecology (IBE). The IBE observed in bobcats is hypothesized to occur due to habitat-biased dispersal, but it is unknown if this occurs at other habitat breaks across their range or at what spatial scale IBE becomes most apparent. Thus, we used a multiscale approach to examine isolation by ecology (IBE) patterns in bobcats (Lynx rufus) at both fine and broad spatial scales in western Texas. We genotyped 102 individuals at nine microsatellite loci and used partial redundancy analysis (pRDA) to test if a suite of landscape variables influenced genetic variation in bobcats. Bobcats exhibited a latitudinal cline in population structure with a spatial signature of male-biased dispersal, and no clear barriers to gene flow. Our pRDA tests revealed high genetic similarity in similar habitats, and results differed by spatial scale. At the fine spatial scale, herbaceous rangeland was an important influence on gene flow whereas mixed rangeland and agriculture were significant at the broad spatial scale. Taken together, our results suggests that complex interactions between spatial-use behavior and landscape heterogeneity can create non-random gene flow in highly mobile species like bobcats. Furthermore, our results add to the growing body of data highlighting the importance of multiscale study designs when assessing spatial genetic structure. © 2021 PeerJ Inc..

To derive an objective framework for choosing among technologies we calculated efficiency measures and conducted a data envelopment productivity frontier analysis (DEA) to compare the efficacy of using manned aircraft (Cessna with Aviatrix triggered image capture using a 50 mm lens) and UAS (Mavic Pro 2) for photogrammetric monitoring of restoration efforts in dynamic braided rivers in Southern New Zealand. Efficacy assessment was based on the technologi-cal, logistical, administrative, and economic requirements of pre (planning), peri (image acquiring) and post (image processing) phases. The results reveal that the technological and logistic aspects of UASs were more efficient than manned aircraft flights. Administratively, the first deployment of UASs is less efficient but was very flexible for subsequent deployment. Manned aircraft flights were more productive in terms of the number of acquired images, but the ground resolution of those images was lower compared with those from UASs. Frontier analysis confirmed that UASs would be economical for regular monitoring of habitats—and even more so if research personnel are trained to fly the UASs. © 2021 by the authors.

In the current study, the intestine samples of 40 American minks (Neovison vison) were molecularly tested for the presence of the above-mentioned Sarcocystis spp. Species-specific PCR of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1) fragments and subsequent sequencing revealed the presence of sporocysts/oocysts of five species, S. elongata (n=2), S. entzerothi (n=10), S. japonica (n=4), S. silva (n=13) and S. truncata (n=21) in the analysed samples. Sarcocystis infection was confirmed in 32/40 (80%) examined samples. In addition, half of the infected animals (50%) were infected with multiple Sarcocystis species suggesting that American minks had access to meat of different deer species, such as roe deer, red deer and sika deer. This causes concern about compliance of hunters and game processing companies with game waste management rules. Further research on the involvement of mustelids in the transmission of various Sarcocystis spp. from different geographical locations is needed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","American mink; Cervidae; cox1; Definitive host; Molecular identification; Sarcocystis","cytochrome c oxidase; cytochrome c oxidase subunit I; unclassified drug; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; deer; host parasite interaction; intermediate host; intestine tissue; meat; Neovison vison; nested polymerase chain reaction; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; oocyst; red deer; roe deer; Sarcocystis; Sarcocystis elongata; Sarcocystis entzerothi; Sarcocystis japonica; Sarcocystis silva; Sarcocystis truncata; sarcocystosis; sequence analysis; sika deer; sporocyst; animal; deer; isolation and purification; Neovison vison; parasitology; phylogeny; Sarcocystis; species difference; veterinary medicine; Animals; Deer; Host-Parasite Interactions; Mink; Phylogeny; Sarcocystis; Sarcocystosis; Species Specificity","Abe, N., Matsuo, K., Moribe, J., Takashima, Y., Irie, T., Baba, T., Gjerde, B., Morphological and molecular characteristics of seven Sarcocystis species from sika deer (Cervus nippon centralis) in Japan, including three new species (2019) Int J Parasitol Parasites Wild, 10, pp. 252-262; Asprea, A., De Marinis, A.M., The diet of the badger Meles meles (Mustelidae, Carnivora) on the Apennines (Central Italy) (2005) Mammalia, 69, pp. 89-95; Baltrūnaitė, L., Diet composition of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes L.), pine marten (Martes martes L.) and raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides Gray) in clay plain landscape, Lithuania (2002) Acta Zool Litu, 12, pp. 362-368; Crum, J.M., Prestwood, A.K., Prevalence and distribution of Sarcocystis spp. among white-tailed deer of the southeastern United States (1982) J Wildl Dis, 18, pp. 195-203; Crum, J.M., Fayer, R., Prestwood, A.K., Sarcocystis spp. in white-tailed deer.

Applying UAS paired with Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) technology to survey forest-dwelling species has been particularly challenging because of unreliable animal detection. We describe our application of UAS and FLIR technology to detect GPS-collared moose (Alces alces) and their calves in the heavily-forested region of northeastern Minnesota, USA, during 2018 and 2019. We conducted grid-pattern UAS thermal surveys over GPS-collared cows during the calving seasons (April to June) of 2018 and 2019 to determine the feasibility of using a FLIR-equipped UAS for detecting cow moose, and for quantifying the number of calves. We also collected data on environmental and flight characteristic variables to model moose detection. Our best fitting model of moose detection showed increased detection with more cloud cover at the survey site ((Formula presented.) = 1.13, SE = 0.43), whereas increased forest canopy ((Formula presented.) = −1.10, SE = 0.38), and vegetative greenness (enhanced vegetation index, EVI; (Formula presented.) = −1.37, SE = 0.32) both reduced detection success. By adjusting our methodology based on our detection model findings, we increased our adult moose detection success from 25% during our first season, to 85% during our second season, and calf detection from 27% to 79%, respectively. We report on our methodological improvements and identify limitations to UAS-based wildlife research in forested systems. Overall, we found that UAS with FLIR sensing is a promising tool for quantifying moose calving success, twinning rate, and calf survival, and may be effective for monitoring the reproductive success and survival of other wildlife species in densely forested regions. © 2021 The Wildlife Society. © 2021 The Wildlife Society","aerial survey; Alces alces; calf survival; detection modeling; drones; FLIR; Minnesota; thermal infrared; unmanned aerial systems (UAS); unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","aerial photograph; cloud cover; detection method; forest canopy; numerical model; quantitative analysis; reproductive success; survival; unmanned vehicle; vegetation index; Minnesota; United States; Alces alces","Adams, K.P., Pekins, P.J., Gustafson, K.A., Bontaites, K., Evaluation of infrared technology for aerial moose surveys in New Hampshire (1997) Alces, 33, pp. 129-139; Addison, R.B., (1972), The possible use of thermal infrared imagery for wildlife census.

Field campaigns across West Kalimantan sites were conducted during both rainy and dry seasons, using mist nets and 10-min point count recordings along transects. We used four diversity indices, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and the Indicator Value index (IndVal) for our analysis. Our results endorsed the general trend found across the tropics of a significant reduction in bird species richness, from the complex natural and old secondary forest structures to the simplified monoculture habitats. We recorded 10,519 individuals across 214 bird species, representing almost 90% of Borneo's lowland forest species. NMDS differentiated intact forest from forest fragments and land under different agriculture uses. Eighty percent of the bird species preferred an intact forest environment. Industrial oil palm sites were the most ‘avoided’ vegetation type. Using IndVal, we found six indicator species significantly associated with forest, three indicator species for depleted forest, one for mixed garden, and none for oil palm plantation. Farm-dependent species richness was strikingly low, and species had little conservation value as per IUCN standards; industrial oil palm plantations were poorest in bird species. Notable exceptions were traditional mixed gardens and old fallows associated with swidden agriculture, when in proximity to forest. These traditional agroforestry systems have higher conservation value than industrial and smallholder monoculture plantations, however, their long-term preservation is uncertain, and monitoring programs are lacking that can contribute to long-term biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service maintenance. More data are needed to determine the viable population sizes for the bird indicator species identified in our study. Such knowledge on population trends can be used to monitor habitat quality and health of forest agriculture landscape mosaics and improve the effectiveness of management, conservation and monitoring in future. © 2021 The Authors","Bird; Indicator species; Indicator value; Indonesia; Kalimantan; Landscape mosaic","","Adam, M.A., Maftuch, M., Kilawati, Y., Risjani, Y., The effect of cadmium exposure on the cytoskeleton and morphology of the gill chloride cells in juvenile mosquito fish (Gambusia affinis) (2019) Egypt.

Temporal partitioning has received less attention than spatial or dietary partitioning but may facilitate niche separation when species overlap along other resource axes. We conducted a broad-scale acoustic study of the diverse and heterogeneous Great Smoky Mountains National Park in the Appalachian Mountains. Between 2015 and 2016, we deployed acoustic bat detectors at 50 sites (for a total of 322 survey nights). We examined spatiotemporal patterns of bat activity (by phonic group: Low, Mid, and Myotis) to test the hypothesis that bats partition both space and time. Myotis and Low bats were the most spatially and temporally dissimilar, while Mid bats were more general in their resource use. Low bats were active in early successional openings or low-elevation forests, near water, and early in the evening. Mid bats were similarly active in all land cover classes, regardless of distance from water, throughout the night. Myotis avoided early successional openings and were active in forested land cover classes, near water, and throughout the night. Myotis and Mid bats did not alter their spatial activity patterns from 2015 to 2016, while Low bats did. We observed disparate temporal activity peaks between phonic groups that varied between years and by land cover class. The temporal separation between phonic groups relaxed from 2015 to 2016, possibly related to changes in the relative abundance of bats or changes in insect abundance or diversity. Temporal separation was more pronounced in the land cover classes that saw greater overall bat activity. These findings support the hypothesis that niche separation in diverse assemblages may occur along multiple resource axes and adds to the growing body of evidence that bats partition their temporal activity. © 2021 The Authors.

Linking these parameters to covariates, such as habitat features, provides additional ecological insight and can be used to make predictions for management purposes. Line-transect surveys, combined with distance sampling methods, are often used to estimate density at discrete points in time, whereas capture–recapture methods are used to estimate movement and other demographic parameters. Recently, open population spatial capture–recapture models have been developed, which simultaneously estimate density and demographic parameters, but have been made available only for data collected from a fixed array of detectors and have not incorporated the effects of habitat covariates. We developed a spatial capture–recapture model that can be applied to line-transect survey data by modeling detection probability in a manner analogous to distance sampling. We extend this model to a) estimate demographic parameters using an open population framework and b) model variation in density and space use as a function of habitat covariates. The model is illustrated using simulated data and aerial line-transect survey data for North Atlantic right whales in the southeastern United States, which also demonstrates the ability to integrate data from multiple survey platforms and accommodate differences between strata or demographic groups. When individuals detected from line-transect surveys can be uniquely identified, our model can be used to simultaneously make inference on factors that influence spatial and temporal variation in density, movement, and population dynamics. © 2021 The Authors.

Its saltmarshes and adjacent conservation polders are used by thousands of breeding birds. However, some alarming population declines have been recorded during recent decades and previous studies found indications that predation pressure from red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and more recently from invasive racoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) played an important role. The current study aimed to assess habitat utilisation by foxes and racoon dogs along the coast of the Wadden Sea. We equipped 21 foxes and seven racoon dogs with GPS collars and recorded a total of 37,586 (mean: 2,088) GPS fixes during a total of 2,617 (mean: 145) equipment days for red foxes and 3,440 (mean: 573) GPS fixes during a total of 272 (mean: 45) equipment days for racoon dogs. Foxes showed high individual variability in Kernel 95% home range sizes, with a mean of 172.2 ha (range: 3 to 824 ha) and little overlap among territories. Males had significantly larger home ranges than females, and there were no differences in home range sizes between adults (n = 14) and young (n = 4). Racoon dogs had smaller home ranges than foxes (mean: 52.8 ha). The preferred habitat type of both predators during daytime was the conservation polders along the Wadden Sea, while foxes also selected saltmarshes during the night. In contrast, both species avoided farmland areas. Foxes showed 20% of their activity during daylight hours and spent this time largely in areas with dense vegetation cover. None of the tagged individuals entered areas with particularly high bird densities (i.e. Wadden Sea islands or Halligen). However, our data suggest that foxes and racoon dogs frequently make use of linear structures such as dykes and dams and patrol along the tide line for carcasses. This suggests that at least single individuals of both species are prone to enter islands that are connected by dams to the mainland. © 2021, The Author(s).","activity; GPS telemetry; habitat use; Home range; wetland","","Bischof, R., Gjevestad, J.G.O., Ordiz, A., Eldegard, K., Milleret, C., High frequency GPS bursts and path-level analysis reveal linear feature tracking by red foxes (2018) Sci Rep, 9, p. 8849; Brown, D.D., LaPoint, S., Kays, R., Heidrich, W., Kümmeth, F., Wikelski, M., Accelarometer-informed GPS telemetry: reducing the trade-off between resolution and longevity (2012) Wildl Soc Bull, 36, pp. 139-146; Bruns, H.A., Hötker, H., Christiansen, J., Hälterlein, B., Petersen-Andresen, W., Brutbestände und Bruterfolg von Wiesenvögeln im Beltringharder Koog (Nordfreisland) in Abhängigkeit von Sukzession, Beweidung, Wasserständen und Prädatoren (2001) Corax, 18, pp. 67-80; Burt, W.H., Territoriality and home range concepts as applied to mammals (1943) J Mammal, 24, pp. 346-352; Carter, A., Luck, G.W., McDonald, S.P., Ecology of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) in an agricultural landscape. 2.

Providing reliable and accurate information about their populations is essential for effective conservation management plans. However, few studies have compared the effectiveness of different survey methods for birds in high altitude arid environments, particularly in the Middle East. Here, we compare the reliability and precision of two sampling methods to estimate densities for two resident bird species in Egypt's Sinai mountains, the white-crowned wheatear (Oenanthe leucopyga) and desert lark (Ammomanes deserti). We conducted surveys for both species in vegetated and unvegetated desert using fixed-width strip transects and line transects using the distance sampling approach, and employed several statistical approaches to compare density estimates. While both methods provided reliable density estimates given sufficient detections of target species, strip transects exhibited more flexibility overall for estimating cryptic and rare species, which comprise a large proportion of this and other montane desert bird communities. Strip transects also entail lower effort and costs, an important consideration given research funding constraints. We therefore recommend strip transects over distance sampling for estimating bird densities in this and other arid montane regions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bland and Altman plot; Density estimates; Desert lark; Line transect; Precision; Strip transect; White-crowned wheatear","community composition; comparative study; conservation planning; desert; elevation; passerine; rare species; species conservation; transect; Egypt; Janub Sina; Mount Sinai; Ammomanes deserti; Oenanthe leucopyga","Albright, T.P., Mutiibwa, D., Gerson, A.R., Smith, E.K., Talbot, W.A., O'Neill, J.J., McKechnie, A.E., Wolf, B.O., Mapping evaporative water loss in desert passerines reveals an expanding threat of lethal dehydration (2017) Proc.

One widely-documented pattern in shallow, tropical reefscapes is sand “halos” that separate coral patches from surrounding vegetation. Multiple hypotheses for this pattern have been proposed, but individual explanations are rarely integrated to reflect the complexity of systems where halos occur. Objectives: To evaluate and synthesize multiple hypotheses of halo formation and maintenance into a single model, connect the halo pattern with similar terrestrial phenomena, and identify targets to guide future research and conservation. Methods: We reviewed halo accounts from over fifty years in the scientific literature and combined them with related research on marine nutrients, bioturbation, analogous terrestrial processes, and new field measurements to create a conceptual model of halo formation and maintenance. Results: Though halos are widely attributed to herbivory, grazing alone cannot explain patterns at all locations. Nutrients have large effects on tropical reefscapes but remain understudied for halos. Coupling nutrients and grazing explains a variety of observed halo patterns. Fish and invertebrate bioturbators also appear important. We combine these factors to explain pattern variability and present a framework for more comprehensive halo research. Conclusions: Explanations for halos to date have been overly simplistic. Halos are common patterns with complex underlying causes, including foraging behavior and nutrient cycling. Not all halo-like patterns may be created or maintained by the same mechanism(s). Our integrated model provides a more complete understanding of factors contributing to these patterns, a framework for ecological interpretations, and a guide for conservation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Bioturbation; Food webs; Grazing; Halos; Nutrients; Seascape","benthos; complexity; ecosystem function; ecosystem health; field method; foraging behavior; future prospect; grazing; nutrient cycling; patch size; research work; Invertebrata","Adam, T.C., Burkepile, D.E., Holbrook, S.J., Carpenter, R.C., Claudet, J., Loiseau, C., Thiault, L., Schmitt, R.J., Landscape-scale patterns of nutrient enrichment in a coral reef ecosystem: implications for coral to algae phase shifts (2020) Ecol Appl, 31. , PID: 32918509; Alevizon, W., Enhanced seagrass growth and fish aggregations around Bahamian patch reefs: the case for a functional connection (2002) Bull Mar Sci, 70, p. 10; Allgeier, J.E., Yeager, L.A., Layman, C.A., Consumers regulate nutrient limitation regimes and primary production in seagrass ecosystems (2013) Ecology, 94, pp. 521-529. , PID: 23691670; Allgeier, J.E., Valdivia, A., Cox, C., Layman, C.A., Fishing down nutrients on coral reefs (2016) Nat Commun, 7, p. 12461. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC28Xhtlylsb%2FK, PID: 27529748; Allgeier, J.E., Adam, T.C., Burkepile, D.E., The importance of individual and species-level traits for trophic niches among herbivorous coral reef fishes (2017) Proc R Soc B, 284, p. 20170307. , PID: 28615499; Allgeier, J.E., Burkepile, D.E., Layman, C.A., Animal pee in the sea: consumer-mediated nutrient dynamics in the world’s changing oceans (2017) Glob Change Biol, 23, pp. 2166-2178; Armitage, A.R., Fourqurean, J.W., The short-term influence of herbivory near patch reefs varies between seagrass species (2006) J Exp Mar Biol Ecol, 339, pp. 65-74; Atwood, T.B., Madin, E.M.P., Harborne, A.R., Hammill, E., Luiz, O.J., Ollivier, Q.R., Roelfsema, C.M., Lovelock, C.E., Predators shape sedimentary organic carbon storage in a coral reef ecosystem (2018) Front Ecol Evol, 6, p. 110; Bartholomew, B., Bare zone between California shrub and grassland communities: the role of animals (1970) Science, 170, pp. 1210-1212. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BC3cvgtVGrsw%3D%3D, PID: 17744053; Bilodeau, S.M., Schwartz, A.W.H., Xu, B., Pauca, V.P., Silman, M.R., A low-cost, long-term underwater camera trap network coupled with deep residual learning image analysis (2021) Biorxiv:2021.03.08.434472, , https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.08.434472; Bonaldo, R.M., Pires, M.M., Guimarães, P.R., Jr., Hoey, A.S., Hay, M.E., Small marine protected areas in Fiji provide refuge for reef fish assemblages, feeding groups, and corals (2017) PLoS ONE, 12. , PID: 5266309, COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2sXhvVGkt7fJ; Brown, J.S., Kotler, B.P., Hazardous duty pay and the foraging cost of predation (2004) Ecol Lett, 7, pp. 999-1014; Burkepile, D.E., Hay, M.E., Herbivore vs. nutrient control of marine primary producers: context-dependent effects (2006) Ecology, 87, pp. 3128-3139. , PID: 17249237; Burkepile, D.E., Allgeier, J.A., Shantz, A.A., Pritchard, C.E., Lemoine, N., Bhatti, L., Layman, C.A., Nutrient supply from fishes facilitates macroalgae and suppresses corals in a Caribbean coral reef ecosystem (2013) Sci Rep, 3, p. 1493. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3sXpvFKjtbo%3D, PID: 23512216; Cabaço, S., Santos, R., Duarte, C.M., The impact of sediment burial and erosion on seagrasses: a review (2008) Estuar Coast Shelf Sci, 79, pp. 354-366; Campbell, J.E., Altieri, A.H., Johnston, L.N., Kuempel, C.D., Paperno, R., Paul, V.J., Duffy, J.E., Herbivore community determines the magnitude and mechanism of nutrient effects on subtropical and tropical seagrasses (2017) J Ecol, 106, pp. 401-412. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2sXhvFKit7jF; Cooper, W.E., Jr., Blumstein, D.T., (2015) Escaping from predators: an integrative view of escape decisions, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Cramer, M.D., Barger, N.N., Are Namibian “fairy circles” the consequence of self-organizing spatial vegetation patterning?

A gene complex found to be associated with morphology in several species is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). However, while several studies have found that greater MHC diversity is associated with larger body size and secondary sexual characteristics, other studies have demonstrated that maximal MHC diversity is not always optimal for the individual’s fitness. This study tested if MHC diversity, measured as pairwise allelic distances at each of two unlinked MHC II loci (exon 2 for the classical antigen-binding protein MHC-DRB and exon 2 for the accessory protein MHC-DOB), was associated with body size (male and female) or antler size in a semi-wild enclosed population of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). After accounting for the effect of age on body and antler size, we used residual analysis to assess whether MHC allelic distances explained any of the remaining variation in body and antler size. While we found no associations between physical characteristics and MHC-DRB, we found that both male body and antler size were associated with MHC-DOB nucleotide allelic distances. Specifically, we found a quadratic relationship between MHC-DOB and male body size, where body size peaked at moderate MHC-DOB nucleotide allelic distance. However, we found a positive linear association between MHC-DOB nucleotide allelic distances and antler size. Neither MHC-DRB nor MHC-DOB influenced female body size, even though the average allelic distances of males and females were not significantly different. Our results suggest that MHC-DOB, or a gene genetically linked to this locus, may influence male morphological characteristics in white-tailed deer. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Major histocompatibility complex; Morphology; Secondary sexual characteristics; Sexual selection; White-tailed deer","body size; deer; major histocompatibility complex; protein; reproductive success; secondary sexual characteristics; semienclosed sea; Odocoileus virginianus","Allaye Chan, A.C., (1991) Physiological and Ecological Determinants of Nutrient Partitioning in Caribou and Reindeer, , PhD dissertation, University of Alaska, Fairbanks USA; Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual selection, , Princeton Univ.

From improvements in finding and catching fish to emulating their natural prey and accessing previously inaccessible waters, to anglers sharing their exploits with others, technology is completely changing all aspects of recreational fishing. These innovations would superficially be viewed as positive from the perspective of the angler (aside from the financial cost of purchasing some technologies), yet for the fisheries manager and policy maker, technology may create unintended challenges that lead to reactionary or even ill-defined approaches as they attempt to keep up with these changes. The goal of this paper is to consider how innovations in recreational fishing are changing the way that anglers interact with fish, and thus how recreational fisheries management is undertaken. We use a combination of structured reviews and expert analyses combined with descriptive case studies to highlight the many ways that technology is influencing recreational fishing practice, and, relatedly, what it means for changing how fisheries and/or these technologies need to be managed—from changes in fish capture, to fish handling, to how anglers share information with each other and with managers. Given that technology is continually evolving, we hope that the examples provided here lead to more and better monitoring of technological innovations and engagement by the management and policy authorities with the recreational fishing sector.

Radio-tagged birds were followed for an average period of 13.1 months (n = 7–22), where a total of 1615 days of fieldwork produced 4420 radiolocations (x = 163.5 radiolocations per tagged bird, n = 142–328). Overall, the mean home range and mean core area of griffon vultures were estimated at 1560 ± 140 km2 (KDE 95%) and 373 ± 36 km2 (KDE 50%) respectively with significant age-related differences within seasons. Immature griffon vultures ranged on average about double the area ranged by adults in winter and occupied significantly larger core areas. The home range overlap in per cent and utilization distribution between adult and immature birds was also significantly less in winter than in summer. Foraging griffon vultures avoided northern slopes with unfavourable flight conditions and selected sites within rangelands with low diurnal temperature variations where overwintering livestock and suitable nesting cliffs occur. Foraging adults were restricted to the vicinity of the breeding colonies and favoured sites away from urban zones. In contrast, immature griffon vultures selected pastoral zones in marginal areas with mild winters and rugged terrain. The existence of predictable food sources in combination with suitable roosting sites and favourable flight conditions were the main factors differentiating the space-use pattern between the two age classes. We recommend that apart from the maintenance of traditional farming practices, sites, such as large communal roosts and flight corridors or entire ‘hotspot’ activity zones of immature birds, should be taken into account in conservation planning and sensitivity mapping for the species. © 2021 The Zoological Society of London","foraging; Gyps fulvus; habitat selection; home range; nursery areas; resource selection; VHF radio-telemetry; vultures","home range; livestock; monitoring system; radiotelemetry; range size; raptor; space use; tagging; Aegean Islands; Crete [Greece]; Greece; Gyps fulvus","Aguilera, A., Escabias, M., Valderrama, M.J., Using principal components for estimating logistic regression with high-dimensional multicollinear data (2006) Comput.

We acoustically sampled 27,796 nights across 846 sites between 15 May and 15 August 2016–2018 within the District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. We developed simulations to determine the number of sites required to document bat species when each site was sampled different numbers of nights. We examined these simulations with respect to land cover, physiographic region, and time period. We generally found that sampling a greater number of sample sites within a survey area increased detection more than increasing the number of nights at individual sampling sites. The sampling effort required to detect a given bat species varied by species, as well as land-cover type and physiographic region. Our results suggest that land managers and researchers should use caution in using protocols developed with other objectives, e.g., the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service endangered and threatened bat species and the North American Bat monitoring programs’ methods are designed relative to their specific needs. Unfortunately, neither protocol may be adequate for accurately detecting bat communities within all mid-Atlantic areas. © 2021 The Authors","Bats; mid-Atlantic; Myotis septentrionalis; Northern long-eared bat; Passive acoustics; Sampling methods","Ecology; District of columbia; Fish and wildlife services; Individual samplings; Monitoring programs; Number of samples; Passive acoustics; Physiographic regions; Sampling efforts; Decision support systems; bat; bioacoustics; biomonitoring; endangered species; land cover; sampling; species occurrence; wildlife management; District of Columbia; Maryland; Mid-Atlantic States; Pennsylvania; United States; Virginia; West Virginia; Columbia; Myotis septentrionalis; Virginia","Andersen, E.M., Steidl, R.J., Power to detect trends in abundance within a distance sampling framework (2019) J.

Here, we investigated the impact of CT placement on the remotely sensed mammal diversity in a tropical forest in Gabon by comparing pairs of systematically placed and wildlife-trail-oriented CTs. Our survey protocol consisted of 15–17 sampling points arranged on a 2 km2 grid and left for one month in the field. This protocol was replicated sequentially in four areas. Each sampling point comprised a CT pair: the ‘systematic CT’, installed at the theoretical point and systematically oriented towards the most uncluttered view; and the ‘trail CT’, placed within a 20-m radius and facing a wildlife trail. For the vast majority of species, the detection probabilities were comparable between placements. Species average capture rates were slightly higher for trail-based CTs, though this trend was not significant for any species. Therefore, the species richness and composition of the overall community, such as the spatial distribution patterns (from evenly spread to site-restricted) of individual species, were similarly depicted by both placements. Opting for a systematic orientation ensures that pathways used preferentially by some species—and avoided by others—will be sampled proportionally to their density in the forest undergrowth. However, trail-based placement is routinely used, already producing standardised data within large-scale monitoring programmes. Here, both placements provided a comparable picture of the mammal community, though it might not be necessarily true in depauperate areas. Both types of CT data can nevertheless be combined in multi-site analyses, since methods now allow accounting for differences in study design and detection bias in original CT data. © 2020 The Authors.

However, considerable uncertainty remains regarding the spatial resolution necessary for effective sampling, especially in aquatic environments. Also, contemporary plant communities are under-investigated with eDNA methods relative to animals and microbes. We analyzed eDNA samples from six small temperate lakes to elucidate spatial patterns in the distributions of algae and aquatic and terrestrial plants, using metabarcoding of the Internal Transcribed Spacer-1 (ITS1) genomic region. Sampling locations were varied across horizontal and vertical space: sites in each lake included a mixture of nearshore and offshore positions, each of which was stratified into surface (shallow) and benthic (deep) samples. We detected the expected community variation (beta diversity) from lake to lake, but only small effects of offshore distance and sampling depth. Taxon richness (alpha diversity) was slightly higher in nearshore samples, but displayed no other significant spatial effects. These diversity metrics imply that plant eDNA is more evenly distributed than its generating organisms in these small lake environments. Read abundances were heavily weighted toward aquatic macrophytes, though taxon richness was greatest in the algae and other non-vascular plants. We also identified representatives of many phylogenetically and ecologically varied plant taxa, including terrestrial species from surrounding areas. We conclude that freshwater plant eDNA surveys successfully capture differences among lake communities, and that easily accessible, shore-based sampling may be a reliable technique for informing research and management in similar ecosystems. © Copyright © 2021 Drummond, Larson, Li, Lodge, Gantz, Pfrender, Renshaw, Correa and Egan.","aquatic plants; biodiversity; environmental DNA; freshwater; ITS1; metabarcoding; monitoring","","Alahuhta, J., Kosten, S., Akasaka, M., Auderset, D., Azzella, M.M., Bolpagni, R., Global variation in the beta diversity of lake macrophytes is driven by environmental heterogeneity rather than latitude (2017) J.

During 2017–2018, 32 points of presence signs of the Persian leopard (Panthera pardus saxicolor) were spotted and they were associated to 6 environmental variables. The maximum entropy (Maxent) model was used to predict the distribution of Persian leopards in the Gisakan, south-western Iran. The validity of habitat suitability model (Training data = 0.844) confirmed the reliability of method. On the basis of Jackknife test, distance from the villages (less presence far from the villages), distance from water resources (the farther from the water resource, the less presence), elevation and slope (most presence in elevations 600–1400 m a. s. l. and slopes 30–70%), distance from the roads (the farther from roads, the more presence) and land cover (more presence in woodlands) variables, respectively, were the most important variables. The results indicate that 25.19% of area (115.13 km2) contains suitable habitat. We suggest that conservation and management plans for leopards be conducted on areas such as studied area that are not formally protected. The results of this study can also help us to identify and protect suitable habitats for conservation and management as well as decrease wildlife–human conflicts. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.","","","Abdollahi, S., (2012) The Effect of Scale on Leopard (Panthera Pardus Saxicolor) Habitat Modeling, , M.Sc.

In addition to the lethal effect of predation, there can also be sublethal, negative effects of domestic cats on individual birds. These effects have led to the inference that reducing outdoor cat densities would benefit urban bird communities. Here we estimate the likely result of policies/programs designed to reduce densities of owned outdoor cats in urban areas, estimating relationships between bird richness/abundance and cat densities across 58 landscapes in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. We estimate that we would most likely observe one additional bird species, and 0.003 additional individuals per species, if policies/programs reduced owned outdoor cat densities to zero in an average landscape in Ottawa (with 130.2 cats/km2). However, these effects of cat density on birds were uncertain, with 95% confidence intervals crossing zero. Our findings—in combination with those of previous studies—suggest a need for research to resolve the apparent disconnect between the strong, negative effects of cats on individual urban birds and the weak, uncertain effects of cats on bird populations. Although measures that reduce owned outdoor cat densities are justified based on the precautionary principle, evidence to date does not support prioritizing these measures over those addressing threats that have consistently strong effects on bird populations. © 2021 by the authors.

The main hypothesis of the study is that vegetation has the effect of lowering the temperature of the surroundings in its shadow and thus improves the comfort of users of cycle paths in the summer months. The second hypothesis is to find out which type of road surface is most suitable for the thermal well-being of users. This goal was achieved by measuring the temperature of selected locations on cycle paths with different types of construction surfaces with nearby woody vegetation using a contactless thermometer over several days at regular intervals. The positions of the selected locations were measured using GNSS and the whole locality of interest was photographed using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), or drone, and subsequently a digital surface model (DSM) of the area was created using a Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm. This model served for the calculation of incident solar radiation during the selected days using the Solar Area Graphics tool with ArcGIS software. Subsequently, the effect of the shade of the surrounding vegetation on the temperature during the day was analysed and statistically evaluated. The results are presented in many graphs and their interpretation used to evaluate the effects of nearby woody vegetation and the type of road surface on the surrounding air temperature and the comfort of users of these routes. The results demonstrate the benefits of using UAVs for the purpose of modelling the course of solar radiation during the day, showing the effect of roadside vegetation on reducing the surface temperature of the earth’s surface and thus confirming the need for planting and maintaining such vegetation. © 2021 by the authors.

The state-of-the-art technology using UAVs has been an increasingly popular tool to monitor wildlife compared to the traditional methods such as satellite imagery-based sensing or GPS trackers. However, there still exist unsolved problems as to how the UAVs need to cover a spacious domain to detect animals as many as possible. In this paper, we propose the optimal transport-based wildlife monitoring strategy for a multi-UAV system, to prioritize monitoring areas while incorporating complementary information such as GPS trackers and satellite-based sensing. Through the proposed scheme, the UAVs can explore the large-size domain effectively and collaboratively with a given priority. The time-varying nature of wildlife due to their movements is modeled as a stochastic process, which is included in the proposed work to reflect the spatio-temporal evolution of their position estimation. In this way, the proposed monitoring plan can lead to wildlife monitoring with a high detection rate. Various simulation results including statistical data are provided to validate the proposed work. In all different simulations, it is shown that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms other UAV-based wildlife monitoring strategies in terms of the target detection rate up to 3.6 times. © 2021 by the authors.

Timor Friarbird is one of the seven endemics bird species widely distributed in Timor Island, from the eastern region of Timor Leste to western region of Indonesia. This research was conducted at Bipolo Landscape, located in Timor Island, and has diversity of tropical flora diversity surrounding its Natural Tourism Park, which provides Timor Friarbird habitat. The characteristics of vegetation ecology were obtained by sampling design through Biogeography Branch’s Sampling Design Tool for ArcGIS, while land use cover type was obtained by maximum likelihood method. The structure and composition of vegetation were observed through nested plot sampling, while Timor Friarbird species were assessed using the combination of point count and line transect method. The result obtained was formulated by discriminant linear regression. The vegetation parameters influencing the presence of Timor Friarbird were tree land use cover, number of trees and their species, pole land use cover, number of poles and their species, sapling land use cover, number of saplings and their species. Timor Friarbird is more likely to be present in the land cover area of poles with a minimum number of individual trees, poles, and saplings (press value Q = 6,63 ≈ 7). The results of discriminant analysis obtained a new group (nine variables), used collectively as a determinant factor for the presence of Timor Friarbird in their natural habitat on Timor Island. © 2021, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

Within carnivore guilds, complex hierarchies of dominance facilitate coexistence, whereby subordinate species avoid dominant counterparts by partitioning space, time, or both. We investigated whether a major life history trait (hibernation) in an apex carnivore (black bears Ursus americanus) mediated its top–down effects on the spatio-temporal dynamics of three sympatric mesocarnivore species (coyotes Canis latrans, bobcats Lynx rufus, and gray foxes Urocyon cinereoargenteus) across a 15,000 km2 landscape in the western USA. We compared top–down, bottom–up, and environmental effects on these mesocarnivores using an integrated modeling approach. Black bears exerted top–down effects that varied as a function of hibernation and were stronger than bottom–up or environmental impacts. High black bear activity in summer and fall appeared to buffer the most subordinate mesocarnivore (gray foxes) from competition with dominant mesocarnivores (coyotes and bobcats), which were in turn released by black bear hibernation in winter and early spring. The mesocarnivore responses occurred in space (i.e., altered occupancy and site visitation intensity) rather than time (i.e., diel activity patterns unaffected). These results suggest that the spatio-temporal dynamics of mesocarnivores in this system were principally shaped by a spatial predator cascade of interference competition mediated by black bear hibernation. Thus, certain life history traits of apex predators might facilitate coexistence among competing species over broad time scales, with complex implications for lower trophic levels. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carnivore guild; Coexistence; Hibernation; Interference competition; Sympatry","bear; carnivore; coexistence; ecological modeling; interference competition; life history trait; predator; spatiotemporal analysis; United States; Canis latrans; Lynx rufus; Urocyon; Urocyon cinereoargenteus; Ursus americanus; animal; bear; Carnivora; climate; fox; Lynx; Animals; Carnivora; Climate; Foxes; Lynx; Ursidae","Atwood, T.C., Fry, T.L., Leland, B.R., Partitioning of anthropogenic watering sites by desert carnivores (2011) J Wildl Manag, 75, pp. 1609-1615; Beckmann, J.P., (2002) Changing dynamics of a population of black bears (Ursus americanus): causes and consequences, , University of Nevada, Reno; Beckmann, J.P., Berger, J., Rapid ecological and behavioural changes in carnivores: the responses of black bears (Ursus americanus) to altered food (2003) J Zool, 261, pp. 207-212; Beckmann, J.P., Lackey, C.W., Lessons learned from a 20-year collaborative study on American black bears (2018) Human-Wildlife Interact, 12, pp. 396-404; Birch, L.C., The meanings of competition (1957) Am Nat, 91, pp. 5-18; Bjørnstad, O.N., (2008) The Ncf Package: Spatial Nonparametric Covariance Functions; Blanchet, F.G., Cazelles, K., Gravel, D., Co-occurrence is not evidence of ecological interactions (2020) Ecol Lett, 23, pp. 1050-1063; Caro, T., (2005) Antipredator defenses in birds and mammals, , University of Chicago Press; Carothers, J.H., Jaksić, F.M., Time as niche difference: the role of interference competition (1984) Oikos, 42, pp. 403-406; Elbroch, L.M., Kusler, A., Are pumas subordinate carnivores, and does it matter?

There is vast untapped potential in the data collected by nonprofessional scientists who volunteer their time to population monitoring, but citizen science (CS) raises concerns around data quality and biases. A particular concern in abundance modeling is the presence of false positives that can occur due to misidentification of nontarget species. Here, we introduce Integrated Abundance Models (IAMs) that integrate citizen and expert data to allow robust inference of population abundance meanwhile accounting for biases caused by misidentification. We used simulation experiments to confirm that IAMs successfully remove the inflation of abundance estimates caused by false-positive detections and can provide accurate estimates of both bias and abundance. We illustrate the approach with a case study on unowned domestic cats, which are commonly confused with owned, and infer their abundance by analyzing a combination of CS data and expert data. Our case study finds that relying on CS data alone, either through simple summation or via traditional modeling approaches, can vastly inflate abundance estimates. IAMs provide an adaptable framework, increasing the opportunity for further development of the approach, tailoring to specific systems and robust use of CS data. © 2021 The Authors.

However, the cocoa pollinator identity is largely unknown and there are important knowledge gaps regarding landscape and farm-level management driving pollinators. Here we analyzed flower visitation with two approaches to quantify how landscape and farm-level factors affect potential pollinators (flower visitors) of cocoa in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. In the first approach (landscape and farm-level) we selected 18 farms and focused on the relative importance of distance to forest (m), potential-pollinator habitats surrounding the farm (i.e. secondary forests and cocoa agroforests [%]), canopy cover (%), leaf-litter amount (kg/m2), and cocoa flower abundance for flower visitors. In the second approach (experimental farm management) we manipulated leaf-litter in 24 farms, because high leaf-litter is suggested to enhance flower visitors. We found that ants and Diptera were the most common flower visitors, and although previous studies suggest ceratopogonids as main cocoa pollinators, none were captured in this study. In the landscape and farm-level approach, potential-pollinator habitats surrounding the farm, and increased canopy cover enhanced ant and Diptera abundance, whereas distance to forest had no effect. In the experimental farm management approach, potential-pollinator habitats surrounding the farm rather than leaf-litter manipulation increased Diptera and ant abundance. In summary conservation of forests and agroforests surrounding the farm, maintaining canopy cover and minimum leaf-litter enhance cocoa flower visitors. Thus, farms with shade trees embedded in a biodiversity-friendly landscape are important for conservation of potential pollinators and pollination services and, thereby, promotion of sustainable cocoa. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Agroforestry systems; Farm management; Flower visitor; Forest conservation; Indonesia; Pollinator habitats","biodiversity; cocoa; conservation status; insect; landscape ecology; leaf litter; pollination; pollinator; Greater Sunda Islands; Sulawesi; Sunda Isles; Diptera; Hexapoda; Theobroma cacao","Altshuler, D.L., Novel interactions of non-pollinating ants with flower visitors and fruit consumers in a tropical forest (1999) Oecologia, 119, pp. 600-606; Anderson, D.R., Model Based Inference in the Life Sciences: A Primer on Evidence (2007), Springer Science & Business Media; Arnold, S.E.J., Bridgemohan, P., Perry, G.B., Spinelli, G.R., Pierre, B., Murray, F., Haughton, C., Stevenson, P.C., The significance of climate in the flower visitor dynamics of a tropical agroforestry system (2018) Agric.

The northern edge of this distribution is in Norway, where they reach up to 72 degrees north. We conducted a study of lynx space use in this region from 2007 to 2013 using GPS telemetry. The home range sizes averaged 2,606 (± 438 SE) km2 for males (n = 9 ranges) and 1,456 (± 179 SE) km2 for females (n = 24 ranges). These are the largest home ranges reported for any large felid, and indeed are only matched by polar bears, arctic living wolves, and grizzly bears among all the Carnivora. The habitat occupied was almost entirely treeless alpine tundra, with home ranges only containing from 20% to 25% of forest. These data have clear implications for the spatial planning of lynx management in the far north as the current management zones are located in unsuitable habitats and are not large enough to encompass individual lynx movements. © 2021 The Authors.

This study aimed to evaluate major determinants that affect the distribution of large mammals in BCF, Chitwan, Nepal that connects the biologically significant Chitwan National Park with the Mahabharat range. The status and distribution of large mammals along the habitat and disturbance gradients were determined by using 29 line transects (mean length = 4.59 ± 0.38 km) that covered a linear distance of 133.13 km. The chital were the most abundant mammals (density per km2 (D) = 8.9095 ± 1.4570 and encounter rate per km (ER) = 1.49) followed by rhesus monkey (D = 38.896 ± 16.013, ER = 0.28), wild boar (D = 14.814 ± 3.57, ER = 0.62), northern red muntjac (D = 9.6566 ± 2.9514, ER = 0.62) and sambar (D = 5.392 ± 2.319, ER = 0.38). Similarly, the sign encounter rate of tiger and leopard was 0.435 and 0.503 respectively. Habitat types, human disturbances, and coverage of invasive and alien plant species (IAPs) played a key role in the distribution of large mammals. The occurrence of mammals was low nearer to the settlements and roads and coverage of IAPs and more nearer to the water resources. However, degradation of foraging grounds such as grasslands by succession and invasion of alien plant species added more threats to the survival of large mammals. Therefore, such a situation can be improved through the scientific management of forests and grasslands. © 2021 Authors.","Disturbance; Habitat heterogeneity; Leopard; Tiger; Ungulates","abundance; disturbance; forest ecosystem; forest management; habitat type; human settlement; mammal; Chitwan National Park; Narayani; Nepal; Cervus axis; Cervus unicolor; Macaca mulatta; Mammalia; Muntiacus; Panthera pardus; Rhinoceros; Sus scrofa; Ungulata","Acharya, K.P., (2018) Conservation Conflict in Nepal: An Examination of the Pattern and Ecological Dimension of Human-Wildlife Conflict and Wildlife Conservation, 92p. , PhD thesis.

Recent research suggests that animals also select habitats and move in ways that minimise their chance of temporarily losing control of movement and thereby suffering slips, falls, collisions or other accidents, particularly when the consequences are likely to be severe (resulting in injury or death). We propose that animals respond to the costs of an ‘accident landscape’ in conjunction with predation risk and energetic costs when deciding when, where, and how to move in their daily lives. We develop a novel theoretical framework describing how features of physical landscapes interact with animal size, morphology, and behaviour to affect the risk and severity of accidents, and predict how accident risk might interact with predation risk and energetic costs to dictate movement decisions across the physical landscape. Future research should focus on testing the hypotheses presented here for different real-world systems to gain insight into the relative importance of theorised effects in the field. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Animal behaviour; dispersal; distribution; energy; fear; habitat selection; mistakes; movement ecology; predation; risk","accident; bioenergetics; fitness; habitat use; predation risk; theoretical study; accident; animal; ecosystem; movement (physiology); predation; Accidents; Animals; Ecosystem; Movement; Predatory Behavior","Alexander, R.M., (1982) Locomotion of Animals, , Blackie, Glasgow; Bajec, I.L., Heppner, F.H., Organized flight in birds (2009) Anim.

Presence of the threatened hazel dormouse (England, UK) is typically confirmed by looking for its nest in survey tubes, over a 6-month period. As an alternative, environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys have proven benefits in efficiency and accuracy for other taxa, but generally rely on the extraction and amplification of DNA from water, soil or sediment, which are not yet dependable samples for rare terrestrial mammals like the hazel dormouse. At a known occupancy site, paper-lined survey tubes were used to capture a DNA sample. Like other species of rodent, the hazel dormouse excretes urine freely, and this was highlighted by ultraviolet torch, swabbed from the paper, extracted and hazel dormouse eDNA amplified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Hazel dormouse presence was confirmed in this way in three out of 50 tubes within 8 days. Detection by conventional nest survey occurred on day 63 when a hazel dormouse nest was found in a single survey tube. We calculate that amplification of eDNA left behind in tubes increased survey efficiency here at least 12-fold. Synthesis and applications. In this study we demonstrate that eDNA swabbed from a clean substrate placed in survey apparatus can significantly hasten the detection of a rare species. This method has the potential to broaden the application of eDNA to other terrestrial vertebrates, including surveys at large spatiotemporal scales. Beyond presence/absence, the non-invasive DNA sample could also offer insights into sex ratio, abundance, behaviour and population genetics. © 2021 The Authors.

They have co-existed with humans throughout the Amazon basin for thousands of years, often having a strong cultural and economic influence on people's lives. Shifts in the socio-economic and political reality of the Amazon basin during the last century have led crocodilian populations to face large variations in their numbers according to different levels of exploitation and strategies for their conservation. This article reviews the scientific knowledge obtained between 1945 and 2019 on the biology, conservation and management for the four Amazonian crocodilian (caiman) species (Caiman crocodilus, Melanosuchus niger, Paleosuchus palpebrosus and Paleosuchus trigonatus). It provides a general overview on past and current population status and research efforts involving caimans in the Amazon basin and discusses perspectives for the future. The most significant studies on the ecology, genetics and management strategies are examined in more detail and this information is contextualized to provide an overview of the most relevant findings that might explain caiman population trends over the last 75 years. Systems for sustainable management in the Amazon basin have been discussed for the past 20 years, but remain rarely applicable. It is necessary to develop new ways to maintain healthy caiman populations through innovative management programmes. Sustainable harvesting of wildlife has been shown to promote conservation targets, especially those initiatives based on community co-management. In this article, we propose some general guidelines for future management schemes, in the expectation that the information provided by the scientific community will be considered fully without political agendas determining the priorities. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","fishing; floodplain; monitoring; protected area; reptiles; sustainability; wetlands","anthropogenic effect; comanagement; conservation management; conservation status; crocodilian; wild population; Amazonia; Caiman; Caiman crocodilus; Crocodylidae (all crocodiles); Melanosuchus niger; Paleosuchus palpebrosus; Paleosuchus trigonatus; Reptilia; Vertebrata","Adan, R.I.Y., Crocodile farming: A multi-million dollar industry (2000) SEAFDEC Asian Aquaculture, 22, pp. 22-28; Antunes, A.P., Fewster, R.M., Venticinque, E.M., Peres, C.A., Levi, T., Rohe, F., Shepard, G.H., Empty forest or empty rivers?

To initiate stand regeneration, foresters commonly reduce tree density to increase light levels for seedlings and enhance primary productivity. These changes in vegetation dynamics, however, could also influence effects of ungulate browsing, resulting in unintended consequences for forest management. Here, we assessed how effects of ungulate exclusion and canopy opening interacted to affect the regeneration of two oak species: Quercus robur and Quercus petraea. We monitored the growth and survival of oak seedlings for two to three growth seasons in paired fenced and unfenced plots under contrasting conditions of canopy openness (8% to 52%) at five sites in southern Sweden and three sites in northeastern France. We scored browsing in the unfenced plots by the four cervids occurring in these areas (Alces alces, Capreolus capreolus, Cervus elaphus and Dama dama). Fencing increased the growth of (mostly taller) seedlings occurring in Sweden and the survival of (mostly smaller) seedlings in France. Both effects increased as canopies became more open. Browsing reduced oak seedling growth in both countries, independently of canopy openness. Canopy openness increased browsing levels in Sweden. Cervid densities did not appear to modify how fencing affected oak seedling growth and survival. In both contrasting forest environments, creating gaps tended to enhance ungulate damage on young forest stands as browsing frequency increased. We conclude that net forest regeneration reflects a subtle equilibrium between enhancing resource availability, boosting seedling growth, and limiting herbivory, which curtails seedling growth and survival. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Fallow deer; Herbivory; Moose; Plant-herbivore interactions; Red deer; Roe deer","Ecology; Forestry; Capreolus capreolus; Forest environments; Forest regeneration; Natural regeneration; Primary productivity; Resource availability; Unintended consequences; Vegetation dynamics; Reforestation; canopy architecture; deciduous forest; recruitment (population dynamics); regeneration; seedling; survival; synergism; ungulate; wild population; Ecology; Forestry; Growth; Natural Reforestation; Quercus; Seedlings; Survival; Sweden; France; Sweden; Alces alces; Capreolus; Capreolus capreolus; Cervidae; Cervus elaphus; Dama dama; Quercus petraea; Quercus robur; Ungulata","Agrell, J., McDonald, E.P., Lindroth, R.L., Effects of CO2 and light on tree phytochemistry and insect performance (2000) Oikos, 88, pp. 259-272; Alexander, H.D., Mack, M.C., Gap regeneration within mature deciduous forests of interior Alaska: Implications for future forest change (2017) For.

The occurrence of reptiles is linked to landscape structure that allows for thermoregulation, shelter and feeding, but the relative importance of these factors is unknown for many tropical and subtropical species. We used community-level occupancy modelling and remote sensing to investigate the effects of vegetation structure and anthropogenic development on reptile occurrence in a Malagasy dry forest during the dry season (June and July). The occupancy estimates for some species revealed that species occupancy increased for more densely vegetated sites situated closer to the forest edge. The proximity of anthropogenic transformation did not significantly affect the occurrence of species except for Uroplatus guentheri which showed preference for sites away from settlements. Because most species and those most sensitive to habitat transformation were associated with edges of intact forest patches with denser green vegetation, these areas should form the focus of efforts to conserve reptiles in tropical dry forests. We also demonstrate how setting and scale can affect how habitat-use patterns are interpreted and the importance of local, species-specific studies. © 2021 Ecological Society of Australia","biodiversity conservation; forest ecology; Madagascar; occupancy modelling; reptile occurrence","anthropogenic effect; conservation management; conservation planning; dry forest; forest edge; habitat fragmentation; habitat use; landscape structure; remote sensing; reptile; thermoregulation; vegetation structure; Madagascar; Reptilia; Uroplatus","Adler-Golden, S., Berk, A., Bernstein, L., (1998) FLAASH, a MODTRAN4 Atmospheric Correction Package for Hyperspectral Data Retrievals and Simulations, pp. 9-14. , JPL Publication, Pasadena, CA; Alexander, G., Marais, J., (2007) A Guide to the Reptiles of Southern Africa, , &, Cape Town, Struik Pub; Andreone, F., Guarino, F., Randrianirina, J., Life history traits, age profile, and conservation of the panther chameleon, Furcifer pardalis (Cuvier 1829), at Nosy Be, NW Madagascar (2005) Trop.

However, many studies have found that urbanization damages the ecosystem, causing a decline in ecosystem services. Nevertheless, few studies have analyzed the spatial interaction between urban public services and ecosystem services. This study aims to determine whether urban public services and ecosystem services can achieve positive synergies. We quantified five critical ecosystem services, i.e., carbon sequestration and oxygen production (CSOP), habitat quality (HQ), water conservation (WC), PM2.5 removal (PR), and temperature reduction (TR), and five urban public services, i.e., education services (EDS), medical services (MS), living services (LS), social security services (SSS) and tourism facilities (TF). We found that a few win–win areas form in the center of Hangzhou city and that it is difficult to achieve positive synergies between urban public services and ecosystem services in urban areas without appropriate ecological conditions. In addition, we found thresholds of urban public services that can prevent a sharp decline in ecosystem services in the process of urban expansion. This research proposes an approach to spatial interaction analysis involving urban public services and ecosystem services and provides insights into the harmonious development of urban ecology. © 2021 The Authors","Spatial analysis; Sustainable development; Urban ecology; Urbanization","Economic and social effects; Spatial variables measurement; Tourism; Urban growth; Water conservation; Carbon sequestration; Ecological conditions; Ecosystem services; Harmonious development; Oxygen production; Rapid urbanizations; Spatial interaction; Temperature reduction; Ecosystems; carbon sequestration; ecosystem service; habitat quality; public service; social security; urban area; urbanization; China; Hangzhou; Zhejiang","Ai, J., Sun, X., Feng, L., Li, Y., Zhu, X., Analyzing the spatial patterns and drivers of ecosystem services in rapidly urbanizing Taihu Lake Basin of China (2015) Front.

In particular wild pigs damage corn more than any other crop, and most of that damage occurs immediately after planting when wild pigs excavate and consume planted seeds. We evaluated whether anthraquinone (AQ), a repellent, could be useful for protecting seed corn from consumption by wild pigs. Specifically, we conducted cafeteria-style tests at 16 bait sites for 6 nights using concentrations of: untreated, 0.5, 1.5, and 3.0% AQ by weight sprayed on whole-kernel corn in AL and TX, USA. We found that repellency for wild pigs was dependent on the AQ concentration, with the greatest repellencies of 95% (AL) and 59% (TX) observed using ~3% AQ. We also found that repellency decreased as the abundance of wild pigs increased at the bait sites. Raccoons (Procyon lotor) did not appear to be repelled by the AQ-coated corn, but white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and mule deer (O. hemionus) were. Overall, our results show promise for the development of a repellent for treating seeds to protect them from wild pigs. We recommend the next steps of testing of the 3% concentration of AQ on corn seeds that are planted underground to optimize the best potential protection against damage from wild pigs. © 2021","Crop damage; Feral swine; Integrated pest management; Non-lethal; Sus scrofa; Wild boar; Wildlife damage management","antifeedant; bait; chemical control; crop damage; deer; invasive species; maize; pig; rodent; United States; Excavata; Odocoileus hemionus; Odocoileus virginianus; Procyon; Procyon lotor; Sus scrofa","Anderson, A., Slootmaker, C., Harper, E., Holderieath, J., Shwiff, S.A., Economic estimates of feral swine damage and control in 11 US states (2016) Crop Protect., 89, pp. 89-94; Anderson, D.R., Model Based Inference in the Life Sciences: a Primer on Evidence (2008), Springer Science & Business Media New York, NY, USA; Bailey, R.G., Description of the Ecoregions of the United States (1980), US Department of Agriculture, Forest Service; Bailey, R.G., Ecoregions, the Ecosystem Geography of the Oceans and Continents (1998), second ed.

Agriculture has changed the Cerrado’s landscape, in central Brazil, where native vegetation remnants are embedded in a non-natural matrix that can be resistant to animal movement. Felines, as carnivores, play an important ecosystem role as predators and are sensitive to habitat fragmentation. The long-term sustainability of small cat populations depends on the connectivity among natural remnants. The Emas National Park (ENP) is an important protected area located in the southwestern of the state of Goiás, a region highly modified by agriculture. We evaluated the landscape connectivity in the surrounding landscape of the ENP for small wildcats of the Cerrado; the margay, southern tiger cat, pampas cat, ocelot and the jaguarundi, based on their dispersal ability and habitat preferences. The habitat availability varied according to each species, the jaguarundi being the species with more habitat available and the margay with less. The ENP is important for the pampas cat and jaguarundi, and the Taquari River Sources State Park (TRSSP) is important for the ocelot, jaguarundi and for the southern tiger cat. The region is of great biological relevance and the lack of remnants around the ENP evidence failure in land management. The method used is a tool to identify priority fragments for conservation and management of the landscape for biodiversity. © 2021, Institute of Zoology, Slovak Academy of Sciences.","Cerrado; Emas national park; Fragmentation; Graph theory; Landscape ecology; Movement ecology","","Adrados, B., Zanin, M., Silveira, L., Non-invasive genetic identification of two sympatric sister-species: ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) and margay (L. wiedii) in different biomes (2019) Conserv Genet Resour, 11, pp. 203-217; Albert, C.H., Rayfield, B., Dumitru, M., Gonzalez, A., Applying network theory to prioritize multispecies habitat networks that are robust to climate and land-use change (2017) Conserv Biol, 31, pp. 1383-1396; (1998) Cerrado: Ambiente E Flora, , Embrapa Cerrados, Brasília; Bagno, M.A., Rodrigues, F.H.G., Villalobos, M.P., Notes on the natural history and conservation status of pampas cat, Oncifelis colocolo, in the Brazilian Cerrado (2004) Mammalia, 68, pp. 75-79; Benedito-Cecilio, E., Minte-Vera, C.V., Zawadzki, C.H., Ichthyofauna from the Emas National Park region: composition and structure (2004) Braz J Biol, 64, pp. 371-382. , (,),.,:., https://doi.org/10.1590/S1519-69842004000300002; Benites, M., Mamede, S.B., Mamíferos e aves Como instrumento de educação e conservação ambiental em corredores de biodiversidade no Cerrado, Brasil (2008) Mastozoología Neotropical, 15, pp. 261-271; Bernasol, W.P., Lima-Ribeiro, M.S., Estrutura espacial e diamétrica de espécies arbóreas e seus condicionantes em um fragmento de cerrado sentido restrito no sudoeste goiano (2010) Hoehnea, 37, pp. 181-198; Bonanomi, J., Tortato, F.R., Gomes, R.S.R., Protecting forests at the expense of native grasslands: Land-use policy encourages open-habitat loss in the Brazilian cerrado biome (2019) Perspect Ecol Conserv, 17, pp. 26-31. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pecon.2018.12.002; Boron, V., Deere, N.J., Xofis, P., Richness, diversity, and factors influencing occupancy of mammal communities across human-modified landscapes in Colombia (2019) Biol Conserv, 232, pp. 108-116; (2000) Lei n° 9.985, de 18 de julho de 2000.

The dataset consisted of 250 published papers that investigated wearables for health-related purposes. Papers focused on technological inputs and health output factors, de-emphasizing theoretical mechanisms that could effectively translate the former into the latter. The lack of transdisciplinary research in the field is limiting both identification of effectiveness and evidence of beneficial health outcomes, with a considerable divide between technologists and public health researchers. Privacy concerns relate to increasing trends in collecting data for mental health and physical health, with the latter escalating exponentially. Invasiveness of wearables has increased over time in terms of collected signals and the derived health information, monitoring both users and their social and physical environments. We conclude with reflections for conceptual development, commercial application and policy regulation. © The Author(s) 2020.","health promotion; invasiveness; mobile media; sensors; trackers; Wearables","","Andreu-Perez, J., Leff, D.R., Ip, H.M.D., Yang, G., From wearable sensors to smart implants-toward pervasive and personalized healthcare (2015) IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 62 (12), pp. 2750-2762; Austad, H., Wiggen, O., Faerevik, H., Seeberg, T.M., Towards a wearable sensor system for continuous occupational cold stress assessment (2018) Industrial Health, 56 (3), pp. 228-240; Austin, S.E., Ford, J.D., Berrang-Ford, L., Biesbroek, R., Ross, N.A., Enabling local public health adaptation to climate change (2019) Social Science & Medicine, 220, pp. 236-244; Banerjee, S., Hemphill, T., Longstreet, P., Wearable devices and healthcare: Data sharing and privacy (2018) Information Society, 34 (1), pp. 49-57; Barr, M., Signal, L., Jenkin, G., Smith, M., Capturing exposures: Using automated cameras to document environmental determinants of obesity (2015) Health Promotion International, 30 (1), pp. 56-63; Becker, M., (2018) Understanding users’ health information privacy concerns for health wearables, , Paper presented at the the 51st Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS), Hawaii; Betti, S., Lova, R.M., Rovini, E., Acerbi, G., Santarelli, L., Cabiati, M., Cavallo, F., Evaluation of an integrated system of wearable physiological sensors for stress monitoring in working environments by using biological markers (2018) IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 65 (8), pp. 1748-1758; Blackman, S., Matlo, C., Bobrovitskiy, C., Waldoch, A., Fang, M.L., Jackson, P., Sixsmith, A., Ambient assisted living technologies for aging well: A scoping review (2016) Journal of Intelligent Systems, 25 (1), pp. 55-69; Borg, K., Boulet, M., Smith, L., Bragge, P., Digital inclusion & health communication: A rapid review of literature (2019) Health Communication, 34 (11), pp. 1320-1328; Brew-Sam, N., (2020) App use and patient empowerment in diabetes self-management: Advancing theory-guided mHealth research, , Springer; Brew-Sam, N., Chib, A., How do smart device apps for diabetes self-management correspond with theoretical indicators of empowerment?

Longitudinal studies are required to identify declines and activate timely management. Population studies of native small mammal communities were conducted across the eastern Otway Ranges during 1975-2007&semi; however, their subsequent status was unknown. We aimed to: Compare the current occurrence and abundance of species and communities (2013-18) to those in previous decades across major vegetation communities (heathy woodland, low forest, sand heathland, headland scrub, coastal dunes and estuarine wetland), and identify change characteristics and management priorities. Live trapping was employed to assess mammals at 30 sites across seven vegetation communities. In total, 67% of sites exhibited large to severe decreases in abundance and only 3% of sites had more than four species compared to 27% in earlier decades. Declines occurred following wildfire and drought, with drivers likely to be multifactorial. While regional declines were significant, higher mammal abundance (two-to six-fold) and native species richness were recorded at coastal dune sites, indicating that this community provides important mammal refuges. Identification of refuges across the landscape and their protection from inappropriate fire and predators should be management priorities. © 2021 CSIRO.

We used three different types of species records to determine the status (i.e. persistence level) of the Endangered red-billed curassow Crax blumenbachii in 14 forest remnants in north-east Brazil, as either persistent, precarious or extirpated. We related these persistence levels to variables measured in a 2-km buffer radius, including variables associated with habitat quality (proportion of forest cover, length of rivers, patch density, distance from rivers) and hunting pressure (proportion of cacao agroforests and farmlands, length of roads, total area occupied by settlements, distance from roads and from settlements). Curassows were more persistent in forest patches located (1) more distant from settlements, (2) in landscapes with few settlements, (3) in landscapes with a high incidence of roads, (4) in a mosaic with a high proportion of forest, shaded cacao agroforest and farmland, and (5) more distant from other forest patches. Hunting pressure potentially exerts more influence on persistence than habitat quality: (1) hunting pressure submodels had a higher explanatory power than habitat quality submodels, (2) final models comprised four hunting pressure variables but only two habitat quality variables, and (3) hunting pressure variables appeared in all models whereas habitat quality variables appeared in only one final model. If hunting pressure is driving declines in curassows, regions with low human presence and a high proportion of forest cover are recommended for establishing new reserves.

This loss is particularly acute in the Atlantic Forest of South America, where it is unclear whether several endemic bird species are extinct or extant. We collate and model spatiotemporal distributional data for one such “lost” species, the Purple-winged Ground Dove Paraclaravis geoffroyi, a Critically Endangered endemic of the Atlantic Forest biome, which is nomadic and apparently dependent on masting bamboo stands. We compared its patterns of occurrence with that of a rare “control” forest pigeon, the Violaceous Quail-Dove Geotrygon violacea, which occurs in regional sympatry. We also solicit information from aviculturists who formerly kept the species. We find that the two species share a similar historical recording rate but can find no documentary evidence (i.e., specimens, photos, video, sound recordings) for the persistence of Purple-winged Ground Dove in the wild after the 1980s, despite periodic sighting records, and after which time citizen scientists frequently documented the control species in the wild. Assessments of the probability that the species is extant are sensitive to the method of analysis, and whether records lacking documentary evidence are considered credible. Analysis of the temporal sequence of past records reveals the extent of the historical range contraction of the Purple-winged Ground Dove, while our species distribution model highlights the geographic search priorities for field ornithologists hoping to rediscover the species—aided by the first recording of the species vocalizations which we obtained from interviews with aviculturists. Our interviews also revealed that the species persisted in captivity from the 1970s until the 1990s (up to 150 birds), until a law was passed obstructing captive breeding efforts by private individuals, putting an end to perhaps the best chance we had to save the species from extinction. © Copyright © 2021 Lees, Devenish, Areta, de Araújo, Keller, Phalan and Silveira.","avian conservation; citizen science; deforestation; extinction; sighting record","","Almeida, E.M.R., Toniato, M.T.Z., Durigan, G., (2010) Plano de Manejo da Estação Ecológica de Bauru, , https://smastr16.blob.core.windows.net/iflorestal/2013/03/Plano_de_Manejo_EEc_Bauru.pdf, São Paulo, Instituto Florestal, (accessed January 12, 2021), :, Available online at; Andermann, T., (2021) iucnsim.

We investigated fish and benthic communities along a ca.345 km section of offshore pipeline in remote northern Australia to compare pipeline communities with those in surrounding areas and provide context for decommissioning risk assessments. We surveyed pipeline and adjacent natural seabed ecosystems at five locations on the continental shelf using remote video technology to quantify fish and benthic communities and modelled predicted fish communities across the study locations. We found that the pipeline supported turfing and low-relief biota (e.g. coralline algae, ascidians, bryozoans, small/encrusting sponges and soft coral or mixed filter feeder communities) with cover >75%. Pipeline benthic communities differed from those in adjacent ecosystems. Within 6 km of the pipeline, the seabed was predominantly sand/silt with only sparse biota; natural hard substrate (e.g. shoal features within 3 km of the pipeline) supported diverse coral and filter feeder communities (average 10–25% cover). Fish abundance and assemblage composition on the pipeline also differed from those in surrounding high- and low-complexity habitats. This difference was driven by high abundance and biomass of commercially important fish species near the pipeline and sand-affiliated species elsewhere. Our study provides important new insights into the marine communities associated with a subsea pipeline in northern Australia; with this artificial habitat observed to support a subset of species known to inhabit the area, but effectively representing a unique assemblage within the region. © 2021","Baited remote underwater stereo-video; Benthos; Decommissioning; Diversity; Fish; Marine park","abundance; agriculture, fishery and forestry; belowground biomass; benthos; biomass; community response; continental shelf; filter feeder; fish; marine environment; seafloor; soft coral; sponge; submarine pipeline; Australia; Alcyonacea; Ascidiacea; Bryozoa; Porifera","Abdul Wahab, M.A., Radford, B., Cappo, M., Colquhoun, J., Stowar, M., Depczynski, M., Miller, K., Heyward, A., Biodiversity and spatial patterns of benthic habitat and associated demersal fish communities at two tropical submerged reef ecosystems (2018) Coral Reefs, 37, pp. 327-343; Althaus, F., Hill, N., Edwards, L., Ferrari, R., CATAMI Classification Scheme for Scoring Marine Biota and Substrata in Underwater Imagery – A Pictorial Guide to the Collaborative and Annotation Tools for Analysis of Marine Imagery and Video (CATAMI) Classification Scheme (2013), http://catami.org/classification, Version 1; North marine parks network management plan 2018 zoning and rules.

The rapid, accurate and nondestructive monitoring of biomass is the key to smart agriculture and precision agriculture. Traditional detection methods are based on destructive measurements. Although satellite remote sensing, manned airborne equipment, and vehicle-mounted equipment can nondestructively collect measurements, they are limited by low accuracy, poor flexibility, and high cost. As nondestructive remote sensing equipment with high precision, high flexibility, and low-cost, unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have been widely used to monitor crop biomass. In this review, UAS platforms and sensors, biomass indices, and data analysis methods are presented. The improvements of UAS in monitoring crop biomass in recent years are introduced, and multisensor fusion, multi-index fusion, the consideration of features not directly related to monitoring biomass, the adoption of advanced algorithms and the use of low-cost sensors are reviewed to highlight the potential for monitoring crop biomass with UAS. Considering the progress made to solve this type of problem, we also suggest some directions for future research. Furthermore, it is expected that the challenge of UAS promotion will be overcome in the future, which is conducive to the realization of smart agriculture and precision agriculture. © Copyright © 2021 Wang, Liu, Wang, Fan, Tian, Qiao and Li.","crop biomass; precision agriculture; remote sensing; smart agriculture; unmanned aerial systems; unmanned aerial vehicle","","Acorsi, M.G., Miranda, F.D.A., Martello, M., Smaniotto, D.A., Sartor, L.R., Estimating biomass of black oat using UAV-based RGB imaging (2019) Agronomy Basel, 9 (14); Alheit, K.V., Busemeyer, L., Liu, W., Maurer, H.P., Gowda, M., Hahn, V., Multiple-line cross QTL mapping for biomass yield and plant height in triticale (x Triticosecale Wittmack) (2014) Theor.

However, species in this group may be strong candidates for photo-identification based on natural skin features that removes many of these concerns, with this technique opening up opportunities for citizen scientists to be involved in animal monitoring programs. We investigated the feasibility of using citizen science to distinguish between individuals of an Australian anuran (the sandpaper frog, Lechriodus fletcheri) based on a visual analysis of their natural skin features. We collected photographs of marked individuals in the field over three breeding seasons using a smartphone device. This photo-database was used to create an online survey to determine how easily members of the general public could photo-match individuals by a comparison of two facial skin features; black banding that runs horizontally above the tympanum and a background array of tubercles present in this region. Survey participants were provided with 30 closed, multiple choice questions in which they were asked to match separate images of a query frog from small image pools of potential candidate matches. Participants were consistently able to match individuals with a low matching error rate (mean ± SD of 26 ± 5) despite the relatively low quality of photographs taken from a smartphone device in the field, with most query frogs being matched by a majority of participants (mean ± SD of 86.02 ± 9.52%). These features were found to be unique and stable among adult males and females. Thus, photo-identification is likely to be a valid, non-invasive method for capture-mark-recapture for L. fletcheri, and likely many anurans that display similar facial skin features. This may become an important alternative to artificial marking techniques, with the challenges of manual photo-matching reduced by spreading workloads among members of the public that can be recruited online.

The populations of the Japanese macaque (Macaca fuscata), which were vulnerable until the early 20th century, have recently recovered. However, this recovery process has rarely been hailed as a conservation success, because it has triggered serious conflicts between people and the macaques. The key exacerbating causes of the conflicts have been the drastic changes in the interrelations between the people, forests, and macaques, as well as the unprecedented social changes in modern Japan (i.e., nationwide depopulation). The aim of this review was to illustrate the bigger picture of these conflicts, by untangling the key root causes, and presenting the outcomes of previous macaque management efforts, which have rarely been presented to the global scientific community. Although recently acquired knowledge regarding macaque management has the potential to support the development of future solutions for the human-macaque conflicts, inadequate responses to the key causes of the physical and psychological hollowing-out of communities across Japan, should be understood as a limiting factor for conflict resolution. This review demonstrates the significance of seeking a resolution for this problem under a wider framework, in order to restructure community designs to be appropriate for the new era of shrinking communities. © The Mammal Society of Japan.","Community design; Damage management; Depopulation; Habitat manipulation; Population regulation","","Agetsuma, N., Ecological function losses caused by monoto nous land use induce crop raiding by wildlife on the island of Yakushima, southern Japan (2007) Ecological Research, 22, pp. 390-402; Agetsuma, N., Minimum area required for local populations of Japanese macaques estimated from the relationship between habitat area and population extinction (2007) International Journal of Primatology, 28, pp. 97-106; Amagasa, T., Ito, H., Distribution of Japanese macaques in Taisyo period (1978) Nihonzaru, 4, pp. 96-106. , (in Japanese); Benchimol, M., Peres, C.

We reviewed previous literature on primate crop feeding in Asia. We found 134 reports from 14 different countries and regions. More than half of the crop feeding cases involved macaques, followed by colobines, especially common langurs, and to a lesser extent by orangutans. No crop feeding by gibbons, lorises, or tarsiers has been reported. Most reports obtained information about crop feeding through interviews with locals and recorded the crops damaged and troop composition, while a few recorded the activity of the target primates and their population parameters. Crop feeding increased when the field was located near the forest, and when natural food availability decreased. Most farmers used non-lethal countermeasures, while some farmers killed the monkeys, and a few used electrical fences to protect crops. In study sites inhabited by multiple animal species, primates are often the worst crop feeders. Human perception and attitudes toward crop feeding primates were affected by income, residential area, religion, and history of crop feeding. Recent studies have created models based on previous data to clarify the potential risk of crop feeding and to predict the monkeys' ranging patterns. To create models for reducing crop damage and to design conservation strategies, collecting fundamental information is necessary. © The Mammal Society of Japan.","Countermeasure; Disease; Macaca; Religion; Seed dispersal","","Adhikari, J.

Freshwater lakes and reservoirs contribute substantially to atmospheric methane concentrations, but the magnitude of this contribution is poorly constrained. Uncertainty stems partially from whether the sites currently sampled represent the global population as well as incomplete knowledge of which environmental variables predict methane flux. Thus, determining the main drivers of methane flux across diverse waterbody types will inform more accurate upscaling approaches. Here we use a new database of total, diffusive, and ebullitive areal methane emissions from 313 lakes and reservoirs (ranging in surface area from 6 m2 to 5,400 km2) to identify the best predictors of methane emission. We found that the best predictors of methane emission differed by waterbody type (lakes vs. reservoirs), and that ecosystem morphometric variables (e.g., surface area and maximum depth) were more important predictors in lakes whereas metrics of autochthonous production (e.g., chlorophyll a) were more important in reservoirs. We also found that productivity strongly predicted methane ebullition, whereas ecosystem morphometry and waterbody type were more important predictors of diffusive methane flux. Finally, we identify several knowledge gaps that limit upscaling efforts. First, we need more methane emission measurements in small reservoirs, large lakes, and both natural and artificial ponds. Additionally, more accurate upscaling efforts require improved global information about waterbody surface area, waterbody type (lake vs. reservoir), ice phenology, and the distribution of productivity-related predictor variables such as total phosphorus, DOC, and chlorophyll a. © 2021.

There is also an urgent problem to be solved for the construction and management of nature reserves in China. Using high-resolution remote sensing image data, this study analyzes the landscape dynamics in the Liancheng National Nature Reserve (LNNR) and their driving factors since the reserve’s promotion to the national level in 2005, and proposes a comprehensive evaluation method for the effectiveness of landscape protection in protected areas based on the Landscape Transfer Index (LTI), Protected Landscape Integrity Index (PLII), and Interfered Landscape Sprawl Index (ILSI). Between 2006 and 2019, the area of protected landscape-namely woodland, grassland, and water-in the LNNR decreased, while the area of interfered landscape such as residential land, industrial and mining land, and water conservancy facility land increased. The LTI was -0.14, and among the driving factors, the development of industry and mining, land use by indigenous inhabitants, and the development of the transport industry made the highest contributions to the landscape transfer tendency, respectively 34.79%, 28.98%, and 17.30%. The results indicate that the overall quality of the landscape declined slightly during this period, mainly as a result of industrial and mining development, indigenous use of the land, and road construction. The PLII decreased from 82.7 to 68.7; this result indicates that the spatial pattern of the protected landscape became more fragmented, and the degree of human interference in the landscape increased. The ILSI increased from 26.61 to 26.68 which indicates that the scope of influence of human interference did not change significantly. The effectiveness of landscape protection in the LNNR is low. Despite the insignificant nature of these changes, they still require attention and timely remedial measures. The methodology proposed in this study may be applicable to the rapid assessment of the effectiveness of landscape conservation in various types of nature conservation sites around the world. © 2021 by the authors.

These individual distinct vocalizations can play an important role in animal communication because they can carry important information about the age, sex, personality, or social role of the signaler. Although we have good knowledge regarding the importance of individual vocalization in social living mammals, it is less clear to what extent solitary living mammals possess individual distinct vocalizations. We recorded and analyzed the vocalizations of 14 captive adult Malayan tapirs (Tapirus indicus) (six females and eight males) to answer this question. We investigated whether familiarity or relatedness had an influence on call similarity. In addition to sex-related differences, we found significant differences between all subjects, comparable to the individual differences found in highly social living species. Surprisingly, kinship appeared to have no influence on call similarity, whereas familiar subjects exhibited significantly higher similarity in their harmonic calls compared to unfamiliar or related subjects. The results support the view that solitary animals could have individual distinct calls, like highly social animals. Therefore, it is likely that non-social factors, like low visibility, could have an influence on call individuality. The increasing knowledge of their behavior will help to protect this endangered species. © 2021 by the authors.

Despite government efforts to recover the population through reintroduction programs, the animal remains vulnerable to heavy snowfall. From March to June 2010, 24 animals were found dead due to heavy snowfall in the Wangpi Stream basin. In this study, we hypothesized that gorals that died due to snowfall are low-status individuals that lived in the sub-optimal or non-suitable areas. Using the occurrence data from extensive field surveys from 2008 to 2010 in the Wangpi Stream and the carcass location data, we (1) defined the goral habitat characteristics and (2) compared the habitat characteristics between dead and living gorals using ensemble species distribution modeling. The results suggested that the sites where dead gorals were found were highly related to typical goral habitats. These results implied that the optimal goral habitats could become uninhabitable following heavy snowfall. Most of the dead animals were pregnant females or were young, implying that they could not escape their primary habitats due to lower mobility. Thus, when there is a climate catastrophe, the optimal goral habitats should be considered for rescue and artificial feeding. © 2021 by the authors.

We also collected and analyzed 147 scats from jackals to determine their seasonal diet and prey selection. The mean (± SE) annual size of home-range ranges (47.1 ± 2.5 km2; n = 4), which were mutually exclusive between mated pairs, was considerably larger than that previously reported for this species, resulting in an extremely low density (0.01 jackal/km2). The unusually large home ranges and low density probably were due to the harsh dry season when most understory vegetation is burned and nearly all waterholes dry up, thereby causing a large seasonal decline in the availability of small vertebrate prey. Resident groups consisted of an alpha pair, but no betas, and were situated only in areas not occupied by leopards (Panthera pardus) and dholes (Cuon alpinus). Jackals avoided dense forests and streams, and had a strong selection for dirt roads, possibly to avoid larger predators. Overall the jackal diet was diverse, with at least 16 prey items identified, and there was no significant difference in diet composition between the cool-dry and hot-dry seasons. Scat analysis showed that the main food items consumed by jackals were processional termites (Hospitalitermes spp.; 26% biomass consumed), followed by wild pig (Sus scrofa; 20%), muntjac (Muntiacus vaginalis; 20%), and civets (17%). Compared to available biomass, jackals were not random in their consumption of ungulates because muntjac were selectively consumed over larger ungulate species. Dietary overlap with dholes and leopards was relatively low, and consumption patterns indicated jackals were preying on ungulates rather than scavenging from kills of larger carnivores. Our results showed that the jackal is an extremely adaptable and opportunistic species that exhibits unique behaviors to survive in an extreme environment near the edge of its distribution. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

When these causes are unclear, intensive post-release monitoring could help identify unknown threats and new management actions. We present an Australian case study involving a reintroduction of the threatened western quoll (Dasyurus geoffroii), a species whose decline was thought to have been caused primarily by predation from introduced foxes and habitat alteration. Intensive post-release monitoring occurred for 5 years after releasing 93 quolls into a semi-arid environment where foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were controlled but quolls had been absent for 130 years. Radiotracking and trapping results indicated that breeding occurred in all years after reintroduction, sufficient shelter sites were present and home ranges (245 ha for females, 2778 ha for males) were similar to other sites. Although cats (Felis catus) were previously considered a threat mainly to juveniles, they were a major threat to population establishment, responsible for the majority of adult quoll deaths recorded after each of three annual releases. Predation impacts were higher in smaller female quolls and quolls living in open habitats. Evidence for selective hunting was supported by the increasing male bias and declining population recorded during trapping. Monitoring results led to an intensification of cat control and suggested that feral cat predation was likely a significant contributor to the historical decline of the western quoll and previous reintroduction failures. This threat would not have been identified without intensive post-release monitoring. Quolls are still extant 7 years after release suggesting that reintroductions can be successful without identifying all causes of decline. Our intensive monitoring program and flexible management strategy were essential for understanding the factors influencing reintroduction success and implementing appropriate mitigation methods. Although logistically challenging and expensive, we urge other practitioners to conduct intensive post-release monitoring and flexible management for reintroductions of formerly widespread species where the original causes of decline are unclear. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Australia; Chuditch; Felis catus; Survival; Translocation; Western quoll","carnivore; conservation management; felid; native species; population decline; predation; reintroduction; Dasyurus; Dasyurus geoffroii; Felis catus; Vulpes vulpes","Abbott, I., Extending the application of Aboriginal names to Australian biota: 'Dasyurus' (Marsupialia: Dasyuridae) species (2013) Vic Na, 130, pp. 109-126; Armstrong, D.P., Seddon, P.J., Directions in reintroduction biology (2008) Trends Ecol Evol, 23, pp. 20-25. , PID: 18160175; Bates, D.M., Maechler, M., Bolker, B., Walker, S., Christensen, R.H.B., Singmann, H., Dai, B., Green, P., Lme4: Linear mixed effects models using 'Eigen' and S4 (2016) CRAN; Brandle, R., (2001) A biological survey of the Flinders Ranges South Australia 1997–1999, , Biological Survey and Monitoring, National Parks and Wildlife South Australia, Department for Environment and Heritage, Adelaide; Brandle, R., Mooney, T., De Preu, N., Broadscale feral predator and herbivore control for yellow-footed rock-wallabies Petrogale xanthopus ssp. xanthopus: improved resilience for plants and animals = Bounceback (2018) Recovering Australian threatened species: a book of hope, pp. 135-146. , Garnett S, Latch P, Lindenmayer D, Woinarski J, (eds), CSIRO Publishing, Collingwood; Burbidge, A.A., Johnson, K.A., Fuller, P.J., Southgate, R.I., Aboriginal knowledge of the mammals of the central deserts of Australia (1988) Aust Wildl Res, 15, pp. 9-39; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (2002) Model selection and multimodel inference: a practical information-theoretic approach, p. 488. , 2, Springer-Verlag, New York; (2012) Chuditch Dasyurus Geoffroii Recovery Plan.

To manufacture fences, it is imperative to assess the behavioural responses of the target species. Here, we investigated the success rate of fences and classified eight behavioural responses of Korean water deer (Hydropotes inermis argyropus) to different fence heights. We explored the association of 801 behavioural responses and defined a threshold based on 40 events by applying non-metric multidimensional scaling and a binary logistic generalised linear mixed model. With fences lower and higher than 1.2 m, recession and rest were the dominant behaviours, respectively, before the deer crossed the fences by performing vertical and running jumps. Considering all independent events, 0.9 m was the marginal threshold, with highly variable outliers over this value. Placing exit pathways for deer and eliminating possible resting areas outside fences are essential for reducing the number of successful jump attempts. The optimal fence height could differ based on conditional factors; however, we recommend a height of 1.5 m considering the cost and roadkill risk. In conclusion, exploring and classifying the behavioural responses of the target species may be critical for establishing appropriate fence protocols. © 2021 by the authors.

Whether this variation is intrinsic (related to tick characteristics) or extrinsic (related to vertebrate host and habitat) is poorly understood but important, as microbiota can influence the reproductive success and vector competence of ticks. We aimed to uncover what intrinsic and extrinsic factors best explain the microbial composition and taxon richness of 11 species of neotropical ticks collected from eight species of small mammals in 18 forest fragments across central Panama. Microbial richness varied among tick species, life stages, and collection sites but was not related to host blood source. Microbiome composition was best explained by tick life stage, with bacterial assemblages of larvae being a subset of those of nymphs. Collection site explained most of the bacterial taxa with differential abundance across intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Francisella and Rickettsia were highly prevalent, but their proportional abundance differed greatly among tick species, and we found both positive and negative cooccurrence between members of these two genera. Other tick endosymbionts (e.g., Coxiella and Rickettsiella) were associated with specific tick species. In addition, we detected Anaplasma and Bartonella in several tick species. Our results indicate that the microbial composition and richness of neotropical ticks are principally related to intrinsic factors (tick species and life stage) and collection site. Taken together, our analysis informs how tick microbiomes are structured and can help anchor our understanding of tick microbiomes from tropical environments more broadly. © 2021.

The use of wildlife detection dogs (WDD) is particularly well-established in North America, Europe and Oceania, and projects deploying them have increased world-wide. However, if they are to make a significant contribution to conservation and management, their strengths, abilities and limitations should be fully identified. We reviewed the use of WDD with particular focus on the breeds used in different countries and for various targets, as well as their overall performance compared to other methods, by developing and analysing a database of 1,220 publications, including 916 scientific ones, covering 2,464 individual cases—most of them (1,840) scientific. With the world-wide increase in the use of WDD, associated tasks have changed and become much more diverse. Since 1930, reports exist for 62 countries and 408 animal, 42 plant, 26 fungi and six bacteria species. Altogether, 108 FCI-classified and 20 non-FCI-classified breeds have worked as WDD. While certain breeds have been preferred on different continents and for specific tasks and targets, they were not generally better suited for detection tasks than others. Overall, WDD usually worked more effectively than other monitoring methods. For each species group, regardless of breed, detection dogs were better than other methods in 88.71% of all cases and only worse in 0.98%. It was only for arthropods that Pinshers and Schnauzers performed worse than other breeds. For mono- and dicotyledons, detection dogs did less often outperform other methods. Although every breed can be trained as a WDD, choosing the most suitable dog for the task and target may speed up training and increase the chance of success. Albeit selection of the most appropriate WDD is important, excellent training, knowledge about the target density and suitability, and a proper study design all appeared to have the highest impact on performance. Moreover, an appropriate area, habitat and weather are crucial for detection dog work. When these factors are taken into consideration, WDD can be an outstanding monitoring method. © 2021 The Authors.

In seasonally variable systems, animals may alter space-use to minimize risk, mediate physiological costs, and maintain access to resources. However, it is often unclear which environmental features influence space-use across seasons, and whether resource selection of non-migratory animals varies in seasonally snow-covered environments. Objectives: We quantified space-use and scale-dependent resource selection of Pacific martens (Martes caurina) in northern California to evaluate the relative influence of abiotic (e.g., topography, weather) and biotic (e.g., forest structure) covariates on spatial ecology of martens in ecologically distinct seasons (i.e., snow-covered, snow-free). Methods: We obtained fine-scale location data from GPS-collared martens (n = 26) in the Cascade and Sierra Nevada mountain ranges in California, USA. We incorporated spatially explicit weather, topographic, and forest structure data in a scale-optimized, seasonal resource selection function framework to determine the relative importance of abiotic and biotic conditions during snow-covered and snow-free periods. Results: During snow-free periods, martens selected for features associated with complex forest structure, including increasing stem basal area. Conversely, space-use was associated with dense forest structure and topographic features in snow-covered periods. Though the relative influence of abiotic and biotic covariates on resource selection varied by season, the scale at which these variables best explained space-use did not. Conclusions: Our results highlight seasonality and scale-dependence of resource selection by martens and emphasize the importance of understanding spatio-temporal responses of free-ranging animals to landscape heterogeneity. We suggest behavioral or ecological requirements that differ by season and scale may influence space-use and resource selection patterns, and, consequently, can inform conservation actions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Carnivores; Forest management; GPS collars; Habitat selection; Movement ecology; Multi-scale; Mustelid; Season; Snow; Spatial ecology","action plan; carnivore; environmental factor; heterogeneity; landscape structure; mammal; resource selection; seasonality; space use; spatiotemporal analysis; topography; California; Sierra Nevada [California]; United States; Martes; Martes caurina; Mustelidae","Aikens, E.O., Mysterud, A., Merkle, J.A., Cagnacci, F., Rivrud, I.M., Hebblewhite, M., Hurley, M.A., Kauffman, M.J., Wave-like patterns of plant phenology determine ungulate movement tactics (2020) Curr Biol, 30 (17), pp. 3444-3449. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXhtlegtLfF, PID: 32619482; Alston, J.M., Joyce, M.J., Merkle, J.A., Moen, R.A., Temperature shapes movement and habitat selection by a heat-sensitive ungulate (2020) Landsc Ecol, 35, pp. 1961-1973; Andruskiw, M., Fryxell, J.M., Thompson, I.D., Baker, J.A., Habitat-mediated variation in predation risk by the American marten (2008) Ecology, 89, pp. 2273-2280. , PID: 18724737; Arnold, T.W., Uninformative parameters and model selection using Akaike’s information criterion (2010) J Wildl Manag, 74, pp. 1175-1178; Avgar, T., Betini, G.S., Fryxell, J.M., Habitat selection patterns are density-dependent under the ideal free distribution (2020) J Anim Ecol, 89 (12), pp. 2777-2787. , PID: 32961607; Bates, D., Machler, M., Bolker, B., Walker, S., Fitting linear mixed-effects models using lme4 (2015) J Stat Soft, 67, pp. 1-48; Bissonette, J.A., Avoiding the scale sampling problem: a consilient solution: avoiding sampling scale problems (2017) J Wildl Manag, 81, pp. 192-205; Boyce, M.S., Scale for resource selection functions (2006) Divers Distrib, 12, pp. 269-276; Brennan, A., Cross, P.C., Higgs, M., Beckmann, J.P., Klaver, R.W., Scurlock, B.M., Creel, S., Inferential consequences of modeling rather than measuring snow accumulation in studies of animal ecology (2013) Ecol Appl, 23 (3), pp. 643-653. , PID: 23734491; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (2002) Model Selection and Multimodel Inference: a Practical Information-Theoretic Approach, , Springer Publishing; Chapin, T.G., Harrison, D.J., Phillips, D.M., Seasonal habitat selection by marten in an untrapped forest preserve (1997) J Wildl Manag, 61, p. 707; Clow, D.W., Nanus, L., Verdin, K.L., Schmidt, J., Evaluation of SNODAS snow depth and snow water equivalent estimates for the Colorado rocky mountains, USA (2012) Hydrol Process, 26, pp. 2583-2591; Cushman, S.A., Raphael, M.G., Ruggiero, L.F., Shirk, A.S., Wasserman, T.N., O’Doherty, E.C., Limiting factors and landscape connectivity: the American marten in the Rocky Mountains (2011) Landsc Ecol, 26 (8), pp. 1137-1149; DeCesare, N.J., Hebblewhite, M., Bradley, M., Hervieux, D., Neufeld, L., Musiani, M., Linking habitat selection and predation risk to spatial variation in survival (2014) J Anim Ecol, 83 (2), pp. 343-352. , PID: 24099266; Delheimer, M.S., Moriarty, K.M., Slauson, K.M., Roddy, A.M., Early, D.A., Hamm, K.A., Comparative reproductive ecology of two subspecies of Pacific marten (Martes caurina) in California Northwest Science, , (In press); Drew, G.S., (1995) Winter Habitat Selection by American Marten (Martes Americana) in Newfoundland: Why Old Growth?

Other ES, henceforth species-based ES, are modelled at small scales based on species providers. As species-based ES are rarely included in multi-service, large-scale spatial assessments, we do not know if these assessments provide accurate information for managing the biodiversity important for species-based ES. We calculate and map weighted provider richness (WPR) for 9 species-based ES by weighting species data in Europe by their functional efficiency derived from functional trait databases. We compare WPR spatial patterns with those of 9 biophysical ES at continental and national scales in Europe. We find positive correlations at continental scale, and weaker positive correlations or neutral relationships at national scale between biophysical ES and WPR. Patterns of synergies and trade-offs for WPR are different from those of biophysical ES and change from continental to national scale. WPR for most species-based ES are synergistic with each other but WPR for existence value has the weakest synergies with other WPRs. Biodiversity data is still insufficient to truly map species-based ES at large scales but WPR can represent the next step forward for spatial ES assessments. A lack of spatial information on species-based ES in large-scale assessments leads to inaccurate information on ES distribution, and their synergies and trade-offs, which can lead to misguided management and conservation decisions. © 2021 The Author(s)","Biophysical models of ecosystem services; Europe; Multi-scale analysis; Species-based ecosystem services; Synergies and trade-offs; Weighted provider richness","","Bartomeus, I., Park, M.G., Gibbs, J., Biodiversity ensures plant–pollinator phenological synchrony against climate change (2013) Ecol.

Despite decades of progress in methodological developments in the realm of population ecology, reliable density estimates are unavailable for many species of conservation concern. The dhole (Asiatic wild dog Cuon alpinus) is one such endangered large carnivore found in the tropical forests of south and southeast Asia. Here, we (i) develop next-generation sequencing resources to identify individual dholes from genetic samples, (ii) apply these methods to identify individuals in the wild, from scat (fecal) samples collected through systematic field surveys and (iii) generate reliable estimates of dhole densities in Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary (Western Ghats, India) using Spatial Capture–Recapture ‘SCR’ models. We estimate dhole densities to be 12–14.2 individuals/100 sq. km based on a set of SCR models, with ~50 individuals within Wayanad's administrative boundary. Our study presents a methodological improvement in generating population estimates of an important apex predator while also offering ecologically informative insights on a species in dire need of science-based management efforts. Replicating this study across connected reserves and over time can serve as a unified framework for understanding population dynamics, population structures, landscape connectivity and metapopulation-level conservation requirements. We propose that the approach presented here may be adopted as an economically and logistically feasible protocol for conservation monitoring of dholes and other ecologically important species plagued by similar issues of data-deficiency, and insufficient funding and resources. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carnivores; Conservation monitoring; Genetic markers; Non-invasive surveys; Population estimation; Single nucleotide polymorphisms; Tropics","canid; carnivore; endangered species; landscape change; mark-recapture method; population dynamics; population estimation; predator; Asia; India; Kerala; Wayanad; Western Ghats; Cuon alpinus","Alexander, J.S., Zhang, C., Shi, K., Riordan, P., A granular view of a snow leopard population using camera traps in Central China (2016) Biol.

Researchers have always considered urban expansion as a cause of deforestation, and that is not an exception for the Chunati beat forest. About 50 % of primary (natural) forests have been logged during last 20 years in the reserve. That's why it becomes essential to assess forest cover to monitor and reduce forest degradation. This paper exhibits a research of forest cover and land use of the hilly area of the Chunati forest cover, Bangladesh by integrating participatory mapping, Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing. The forest cover and land use map were produced by using a participatory mapping approach, where the several complex spatial features are marked and monitored with the help of spatial knowledge of local community and satellite images. The study also demonstrates the degradation of the Chunati forest and the conflicts between humans and nature. About 16 % of well stock forest of Chunati beat was degraded by illegal logging and encroachment inside the reserve forest which are the prime factors that need to be restricted. The Forest Department faced difficulties while carrying out restoration, as the forest area was not demarcated. The maps produced during this research estimate the total area encroached by anthropogenic activities. These maps can help policy makers to monitor the Chunati forest cover which will further help to implement land use policy and forest conservation. © 2020","Bangladesh; Forest cover; GIS; Land use/land cover; Participatory mapping; Remote sensing","forest cover; GIS; land cover; land use; mapping; remote sensing; satellite imagery; wildlife management; Bangladesh; Varanidae","Biswas, S.R., Choudhury, J.K., Forests and forest management practices in Bangladesh: the question of sustainability1 (2007) Int.

We used long-term spotlight surveys to assess spatiotemporal dynamics of bare-nosed wombats (Vombatus ursinus), encompassing 34 years of surveys for the Tasmanian mainland sub-species (V. u. tasmaniensis, 1985–2018) and 25 years for the Flinders Island sub-species (V. u. ursinus, 1994–2018). Wombat populations increased on the Tasmanian mainland by 2.59 times and on Flinders Island by 3.51 times ((Formula presented.) = 1.05 and 1.1 times increase/yr, respectively). At smaller spatial scales on mainland Tasmania, increases in wombat counts generally occurred within meteorological regions and regional zones, except for the Central North (West Tamar) region where a decrease in wombats is linked to a sarcoptic mange disease epizootic. We used generalized additive models to assess relationships between variables and wombat counts. The most supported variables at the mainland Tasmania scale were (in order of importance) year, positive associations with time-lagged minimum temperature, Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) counts, and moonlight, and a negative association with time-lagged rainfall. Among meteorological regions, variables associated with wombat counts exhibited some heterogeneity, with temperature and rainfall the most frequently associated variables. Our long-term, large-scale, and ecologically diverse analysis of bare-nosed wombats supports spotlight monitoring as a valuable, relatively simple, and affordable survey method in Tasmania and beyond. © 2021 The Wildlife Society. © 2021 The Wildlife Society","bare-nosed wombat; common wombat; geographically widespread species; population dynamics; population trajectory; spotlight survey; Vombatus ursinus","additive; bat; disease transmission; protected area; rainfall; spatiotemporal analysis; species conservation; trend analysis; Australia; Flinders Island; South Australia; Tasmania; Sarcophilus harrisii; Tasmania; Vombatidae; Vombatus ursinus","Anderson, M.A., Calculating and interpreting percentage changes for economic analysis (2019) Applied Economics Teaching Resources, 1, pp. 25-31; Banks, P.B., Predation by introduced foxes on native bush rats in Australia: do foxes take the doomed surplus?
