However, people can also perceive smaller species of carnivores as threatening, particularly in urban areas. Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) started to colonize British cities in the 1930s, and there is growing public concern about foxes biting people, particularly babies. These events are generally described in the press as attacks and generate intense media coverage and speculation that foxes view human infants as potential prey. Because foxes rely primarily on auditory cues for hunting, we conducted acoustic playback experiments in the gardens of 15 residential houses in northwest Bristol, United Kingdom, in December 2015 and 11 gardens from May to June 2016 to determine whether urban foxes were attracted to infant distress calls (cries). Foxes were not more likely to be attracted to infant cries or laughs than silence, although a minority of foxes cautiously approached and contacted the source of both types of infant vocalization. Their behavior appeared to be investigative rather than aggressive or predatory. Our review of the incidents reported in the British media showed that most people were bitten or scratched while sleeping, and adults were more likely to be bitten than children. The nature of the interactions and the wounds inflicted suggest that the foxes were using their mouth or forefeet to investigate an unusual object. Most incidents occurred inside people's homes, even though it is unusual for foxes to enter houses. The data suggested that incidents where people were bitten were chance events, possibly involving a particularly bold fox. To minimize the risk to the public, more quantitative data are required on the age, social status, and health of the foxes that enter houses and those that bite people. © Jack H.

Samples for genetic analysis were collected alongside conventional surveys for birds, mammals, amphibians and reptiles, insects, vegetation, fish, plankton and benthic invertebrates, with the aim of optimizing biological monitoring for a gas pipeline. Environmental DNA samples were collected by filtering water and sequenced to identify the fish communities using an approach called DNA metabarcoding. Plankton and benthic invertebrates were collected as per the usual methodology but were identified by metabarcoding, while birds were targeted by collecting flying insects and sequencing the DNA ingested via blood meals. The design for environmental DNA sampling includes two field campaigns: during the wet season and the dry season of 2019, in parallel with the monitoring where conventional techniques are used. The first field campaign was carried out from March 23th to April 24th of this year (wet season) and the dry season campaign was carried out from August to September of this year. A total of 338 vertebrate taxa were detected from 34 eDNA samples, while 52 vertebrate taxa were detected from the 26 iDNA samples. Results will be compared against those from the conventional monitoring programme to assess comparability of species lists and the power of the data for showing changes in communities along disturbance gradients, but immediate results suggest that, at least for eDNA, an average of 7.5 times more fish taxa than were with nets. The advantage of the application of DNA techniques is in the capacity that they have to capture tremendous amounts of data with less sampling effort and logistical difficulties, combined this allows more extensive and intensive monitoring, which further facilitates the implementation of management strategies in remote and sensitive areas. © 2020, Society of Petroleum Engineers","","Birds;

Consequently, fire regimes have been modified throughout history through both intentional burning to promote benefits and active suppression to reduce risks. Reintroducing fire and its benefits back into the Sky Island mountains of the United States-Mexico borderlands has the potential to reduce adverse effects of altered fire regimes and build resilient ecosystems and human communities. To help guide regional fire restoration, we describe the frequency and severity of recent fires over a 32-year period (1985-2017) across a vast binational region in the United States-Mexico borderlands and assess variation in fire frequency and severity across climate gradients and in relation to vegetation and land tenure classes. We synthesize relevant literature on historical fire regimes within 9 major vegetation types and assess how observed contemporary fire characteristics vary from expectations based on historical patterns. Less than 28% of the study area burned during the observation period, excluding vegetation types in warmer climates that are not adapted to fire (eg, Desertscrub and Thornscrub). Average severity of recent fires was low despite some extreme outliers in cooler, wetter environments. Midway along regional temperature and precipitation gradients, approximately 64% of Pine-Oak Forests burned at least once, with fire frequencies that mainly corresponded to historical expectations on private lands in Mexico but less so on communal lands, suggesting the influence of land management. Fire frequency was higher than historical expectations in extremely cool and wet environments that support forest types such as Spruce-Fir, indicating threats to these systems possibly attributable to drought and other factors. In contrast, fires were absent or infrequent across large areas of Woodlands (~73% unburned) and Grasslands (~88% unburned) due possibly to overgrazing, which reduces abundance and continuity of fine fuels needed to carry fire. Our findings provide a new depiction of fire regimes in the Sky Islands that can help inform fire management, restoration, and regional conservation planning, fostered by local and traditional knowledge and collaboration among landowners and managers. © The Author(s) 2020.","climate;

The recent growth in citizen science is largely attributed to technology and has resulted in citizen science now recognised as having the potential to augment and enhance traditional scientific research and monitoring. Citizen science can deliver a level of spatial granularity often not possible with conventional research. This, coupled with its potential to engage the public meaningfully in science, uniquely positions citizen science to monitor and thereby effect genuine scientific outcomes. However, the rapid growth in citizen science has also resulted in some data and information challenges that need to be overcome. Here we present a general overview of citizen science and some of the opportunities and challenges associated with its rapid growth, with a focus on Australia. We use case studies of successful citizen science projects in New South Wales to demonstrate its potential across areas such as cost efficiency and scalability. Overall, these examples show how citizen science has the potential to provide a monumental shift in our ability to monitor the environment while simultaneously increasing understanding and trust in science within the broader community. © 2020 Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales.

In Namibia, both white (Ceratotherium simum) and black (Diceros bicornis) rhinoceros occur on private land, in the latter case under a custodianship program of the Namibian Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET). Black rhinoceros custodian landowners are responsible for the protection of the rhinoceroses on their land and are required to report regularly to the MET. Monitoring imposes a financial burden on custodians yet many of the techniques used involve expensive monitoring techniques that include the need for aerial support and/or animal instrumentation. During May and June 2018, WildTrack undertook a pilot study to census black and white rhinoceros on three private custodianship properties in Namibia. We tested three footprint identification methods for obtaining estimates of rhinoceros populations in an effort to provide less costly alternative monitoring options to rhinoceros custodians. The first was a full monitoring protocol with two components: (a) tracking each individual animal and matching them to their footprints, (b) identifying those individuals from the heel lines on the prints. The second method used simple visual heel line identification ex-situ, and the third method used just an objective footprint identification technique. These methods offer different options of fieldwork labour and cost and were designed to offer monitoring options to custodians that provided information about rhinoceros movement and location, with minimal disturbance to the rhinoceros, and best matched their human and economic resources. In this study, we describe the three methods and report the results of the pilot study to compare and evaluate their utility for rhinoceros monitoring. The first method successfully matched each trail photographed to a known rhinoceros at each site. When the other two methods disagreed with the first, they did so by failing to match single trails to a known rhinoceros, thereby creating fictitious identities consisting of a single trail. This failure occurred twice in one application, but otherwise at most once. We expect this failure can be eliminated through more stringent criteria for collecting photographs of footprints. We also briefly compare the use of footprint monitoring with other commonly used monitoring techniques. On this basis, landowners hosting rhinoceros can evaluate which method best suits their needs and resources. © 2020 Jewell et al.","Custodianships; Footprint identification technique; Footprints; Heel patterns; Namibia; Non-invasive; Population monitoring; Rhinoceros; Tracking; Traditional ecological knowledge","adult; article; female; field work; heel; human; male; Namibia; photography; pilot study","Alibhai, SK, Jewell, ZC., (1997) Black rhino censusing and monitoring using a spoor recognition technique.

High–throughput sequencing offers new possi-bilities in molecular ecology and conservation studies. However, its potential has not yet become fully exploited for noninvasive studies of free–ranging animals, such as those based on feces. High–throughput sequencing allows sequencing of short DNA fragments and could allow simultaneous genotyping of a very large number of samples and markers at a low cost. The application of high throughput genotyping to fecal samples from wildlife has been hindered by several labor–intensive steps. We evaluate alternative protocols which could allow higher throughput for two of these steps: sample collection and DNA extraction. Two different field sampling and seven different DNA extraction methods are tested here on grey wolf (Canis lupus) feces. There was high variation in genotyping success rates. The field sampling method based on surface swabbing performed much worse than the extraction from a fecal fragment. In addition, there is a lot of room for improvement in the DNA extraction step. Optimization of protocols can lead to very much more efficient, cheaper and higher throughput noninvasive monitoring. Selection of appropriate markers is still of paramount importance to increase genotyping success. © 2020 Global Research Online.

However, models often neglect nonclimatic factors, such as herbivory, which could slow down or prevent geographic range expansion. A previous study in Mont Mégantic National Park (Quebec) found that in one year (2016), browsing by white-tailed deer on Trillium erectum L. was substantially higher at high elevations than low elevations. Under the hypothesis that deer herbivory could limit the upper elevational range expansion of T. erectum, here we ask (i) whether herbivory increased with elevation during two additional years (2017 and 2018), (ii) whether the rate of deer visitation increases with elevation, and (iii) whether the effect of herbivory on relative growth rates increases with elevation. Contrary to the earlier study, we did not find a significant trend of herbivory with elevation, although there was a weak positive relationship between deer visitation and elevation. We found a strong negative impact of browsing on relative growth rates, but the magnitude of this effect did not vary with elevation. Our results thus do not support the hypothesis that herbivory limits the range of T. erectum at high elevation, but herbivory could have a negative impact on populations in general if the browsing rate remains high. © 2020, Canadian Science Publishing.

The diversity in drone platforms, sensors, and applications necessitates the reporting of specific details for replication, but there is little guidance available on how to detail drone use in peer-reviewed articles. Here, we present a standardized protocol to assist researchers in reporting of their drone use in wildlife research. The protocol is delivered in six sections: Project Overview; Drone System and Operation Details; Payload, Sensor, and Data Collection; Field Operation Details; Data Post-Processing; and Permits, Regulations, Training, and Logistics. Each section outlines the details that should be included, along with justifications for their inclusion. To facilitate ease of use, we have provided two example protocols, retroactively produced for published drone-based studies by the authors of this protocol. Our hopes are that the current version of this protocol should assist with the communication, dissemination, and adoption of drone technology for wildlife research and management. © 2020, Canadian Science Publishing.

However, obtaining information on population status often involves invasive sampling of a certain number of individual animals. Marking and sampling practices include taking blood and tissue samples, toe-clipping of amphibians and rodents, or using implants and radio-Transmitters-techniques that can negatively affect the animal. Wildlife research may then result in a fundamental conflict between individual animal welfare and the welfare of the population or ecosystem, which could be significantly reduced if non-invasive research practices were more broadly implemented. Implementation of non-invasive methods could be guided by the so-called 3Rs principles for animal research (replace, reduce, refine), which were proposed by Russell and Burch 60 years ago and have become a part of many animal protection legislations worldwide. However, the process of incorporating the 3Rs principles into wildlife research has been unfortunately rather slow and their importance overlooked. In order to help alleviate this situation, here I provide an overview of the most common practices in wildlife research, discuss their potential impact on animal welfare, and present available non-invasive alternatives. © 2020 The Author.","3Rs principles; animal welfare; ecology; reduction; refinement; replacement","","Afonso, E., Is the lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros) exposed to causes that may have contributed to its decline?

Box 174250, Bozeman, MT  59717-4250, United States","Large carnivores are sensitive to human-caused extirpation due to large home ranges, low population densities, and low reproductive rates. Protected areas help maintain populations by acting as sources, but human-caused mortality, habitat displacement, and edge effects occurring at protected area boundaries may reduce that function. The national parks Banff, Yoho, and Kootenay in the Canadian Rocky Mountains are refugia for large carnivores, including wolverines (Gulo gulo (Linnaeus, 1758)). Despite growing conservation concern, empirical baseline population data for wolverines remain scarce throughout their range, including most of Canada. We hypothesized (i) that in these national parks, wolverine density matched values expected for high-quality habitat, and (ii) that edge effects decreased density towards park boundaries. We conducted systematic non-invasive genetic sampling surveys covering &gt;7000 km2 (2011 and 2013). Using spatial capture–recapture models, we estimated mean (±SE) female (1.5 ± 0.3 and 1.4 ± 0.3 wolverine/1000 km2), male (1.8 ± 0.4 and 1.5 ± 0.3 wolverine/1000 km2), and combined (3.3 ± 0.5 and 3.0 ± 0.4 wolverine/1000 km2) densities for 2011 and 2013, respectively. These estimates were lower than predictions based on density extrapolation from nearby high-quality habitat, and density decreased towards park boundaries. To benefit the population, we recommend creating buffer zones around parks that protect female habitat and prohibit harvest. © 2020, Canadian Science Publishing.

Here, we model the redistribution of meltwater following spring snowmelt as well as the accumulation of meltwater and dissolved nitrate at landscape scale. By combining snow mapping with unmanned aerial systems, snow chemistry, and hydrological modelling, we argue that the majority of nitrate in the snowpack is flushed out of the landscape due to the limited storage capacity of meltwater in the early growing season frozen soil. We illustrate how landscape micro-topography is a crucial parameter to quantify storage capacity of meltwater at landscape scale and thereby the associated pool of soluble compounds such as nitrate. This pool will be available for plants and may be important for plant diversity and growth rates in the wettest part of the landscape. This study illustrates that the evenly distributed nitrate input during the Arctic winter may be redistributed during the initial snowmelt and lead to marked differences in biologically available nitrate at the onset of the growing season, but also that the majority of deposited nitrate in snow is lost from the terrestrial to the aquatic environment during snowmelt. © 2020 The Author(s).

To adapt a rice-dependent country’s farming to the impacts of climate change, it is necessary to assess and monitor the potential risk that climate change poses to agriculture. The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between rice grain protein content (GPC) and meteorological variables through unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing and meteorological measurements. Furthermore, a method for GPC estimation that combines remote sensing data and meteorological variables was proposed. The conclusions of this study were as follows: (1) The accuracy and robustness of the GPC estimation model were improved by evaluating the nitrogen condition with the green normalized difference vegetation index at the heading stage (GNDVIheading) and evaluating photosynthesis with the average daily solar radiation during the grain-filling stage (SRgrain-filling). GPC estimation considering SRgrain-filling in addition to GNDVIheading was able to estimate the observed GPC under the different conditions. (2) Increased temperature from the transplantation date to the heading stage can affect increased GPC when extreme temperature does not cause the heat stress. © 2020 by the authors.

José Antonio Nováis 12, Madrid, 28040, Spain","Understanding predator-prey relationships is fundamental to develop effective conservation plans. Between 2015 and 2018, we combed 21 transects, each 7km long, searching for Iberian Lynx Lynx pardinus scat within the province of Madrid in central Spain. In order to minimise inherent subjectivity of visual identification as much as possible, we performed a double specific nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by a primer extension assay addressed to two Iberian Lynx diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms. Forty-six scat samples were positively identified as belonging to Iberian Lynx through genetic analysis. From these, we extracted remains of consumed prey, which we determined to the lowest possible taxonomic level, mainly through hair identification. Identified prey was divided into four types: lagomorphs, small mammals, birds, and ungulates. The species' diet composition was described based on the frequency of occurrence (FO) of each prey and niche breadth, and also compared with prior knowledge of the species using four prior studies as a comparative reference through the calculation of the niche overlap value. The FO of lagomorphs (39%) was the lowest, while the FO of small mammals (54%) was the highest recorded to date. The niche breath (0.36) was higher than recorded in prior studies, but still showing the specialist character of the Iberian Lynx. Niche overlap was low (C = 0.49), showing differences in trophic niche between the population in our study area and the one studied in southern Spain. This indicates that the Iberian Lynx is adept at switching its main prey, an ability that has previously been firmly rejected. It is, however, capable of adapting to alternative prey more often than recorded to date, which could be a behavioural response to the patchy distribution of European Rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus in the study area. © Alfaya et al. 2020.","Diet; Lagomorphs; Niche breadth; Niche overlap; Single nucleotide polymorphism","","Alfaya, P., Casanovas, J.G., Lobón-Rovira, J., Matallanas, B., Cruz, A., Arana, P., Alonso, G., Using MaxEnt algorithm to assess habitat suitability of a potential Iberian Lynx population in central Iberian Peninsula (2019) Community Ecology, 20 (3), pp. 266-267. , https://doi.org/10.1556/168.2019.20.3.7; Araujo, M.S., Bolnick, D.I., Layman, C.A., The ecological causes of individual specialisation (2011) Ecology Letters, 14, pp. 948-958. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01662.x; Arnaiz-Schmitz, C., Díaz, P., Ruiz-Labourdette, D., Herrero-Jáuregui, C., Molina, M., Montes, C., Pineda, F.D., Schmitz, M.F., Modelling of socio-ecological connectivity.

However, the multitude of interacting factors underlying the impacts of these threats remain poorly understood in tropical forests. This is unfortunate because the majority of terrestrial biodiversity resides in these habitats. The responses of organisms to environmental changes are often studied indirectly, for example, using discrete snapshots at different time periods at the same location. This is due to the challenges of compiling long-term data, especially for invertebrates. Evaluating how functionally important species assemblages will respond to anthropogenic threats requires continuous long-term monitoring. This is vital for arthropods because they are responsible for crucial ecosystem services and human food security. Here, we review existing arthropod monitoring schemes and consider some innovative avenues for future research that promise to improve monitoring of this important group in tropical systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Ecosystem service; Functional trait; Insect; Metabarcoding; Monitoring; Network structure; Thermal tolerance; Tropical forest","","Agosti, D., Majer, J., Alonso, L.E., Schultz, T., Ants: Standard Methods for Measuring and Monitoring Biodiversity (2000), Smithsonian Institution Press; Altermatt, F., Climatic warming increases voltinism in European butterflies and moths (2010) Proc.

We also built a system capable of classifying all these 34 animal classes from images as well as in real-time from videos or a webcam. Additionally, our system is capable to automatically generate two new datasets, one dataset containing textual information (i.e. animal class name, date and time interval when the animal was present in the frame) and one dataset containing images of the animal classes present and identified in videos or in front of a webcam. Our experimental results show a high overall test accuracy for all 4 proposed architectures (90.56% for VGG-19 model, 93.41% for InceptionV3 model, 93.49 for ResNet-50 model and 94.54% for MobileNetV2 model), proving that such systems enable an unobtrusive method for gathering a rich collection of information about the vast numbers of animal classes that are being identified such as providing insights about what animal classes are present at a given date and time in a certain area and how they look, resulting in valuable datasets especially for researchers in the area of ecology. © 2020 SPIE.","Animals; Birds; Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep Learning; Real-Time","Birds; Computer vision; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Proposed architectures; Real time; Real-time identification; Test accuracy; Textual information; Time interval; Animals","Fiedler, W., New technologies for monitoring bird migration and behaviour (2009) Ringing & Migration, 24 (3), pp. 175-179; Sadegh Norouzzadeh, M., Automatically identifying, counting, and describing wild animals in camera-trap images with deep learning (2018) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS), 115 (25), pp. 6315-6512; AI for Earth, , https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-earth; https://www.inaturalist.org/; Merlin Photo ID, , http://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/; Nguyen, H., Animal recognition and identification with deep convolutional neural networks for automated wildlife monitoring (2017) 2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA), pp. 40-49. , Tokyo; Verma, G.K., Gupta, P., Wild animal detection using deep convolutional neural network (2018) Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, pp. 327-338; Manohar, N., Kumar, Y.H., Rani, R., Hemantha Kumar, G., Convolutional neural network with SVM for classification of animal images (2019) Emerging Research in Electronics, Computer Science and Technology.

The species' preference for cool, high-altitude habitats makes it particularly vulnerable to a shifting climate as these habitats recede. Aside from basic breeding and dietary patterns, the species' ecology is largely unknown. Understanding fine-scale habitat attributes preferred by this endangered mammal is critical to employ successful conservation management. Here, we assess vegetation attributes of known habitats over three sites at Springbrook and Border Ranges National Parks, including detailed structure data and broad floristic assessment. Floristic compositional assessment of the high-altitude cloud rainforest indicated broad similarities. However, only 22% of plant species were shared between all sites indicating a high level of local endemism. This suggests a diverse assemblage of vegetation across A. arktos habitats. Habitat characteristics were related to capture records of A. arktos to determine potential fine-scale structural habitat requirements. Percentage of rock cover and leaf litter were the strongest predictors of A. arktos captures across survey sites, suggesting a need for foraging substrate and cover. Habitat characteristics described here will inform predictive species distribution models of this federally endangered species and are applicable to other mammal conservation programs. © 2020 The Authors.

Currently, there is no published information about how to scientifically assess the welfare of free-roaming wild animals during their normal day-to-day lives. Using free-roaming horses as an example, we describe a ten-stage protocol for systematically and scientifically assessing the welfare of individual non-captive wild animals. The protocol starts by emphasising the importance of readers having an understanding of animal welfare in a conservation context and also of the Five Domains Model for assessing welfare. It goes on to detail what species-specific information is required to assess welfare, how to identify measurable and observable indicators of animals’ physical states and how to identify which individuals are being assessed. Further, it addresses how to select appropriate methods for measuring/observing physical indicators of welfare, the scientific validation of these indicators and then the grading of animals’ welfare states, along with assigning a confidence score. Finally, grading future welfare risks and how these can guide management decisions is discussed. Applying this ten-stage protocol will enable biologists to scientifically assess the welfare of wild animals and should lead to significant advances in the field of wild animal welfare. © 2020 by the authors.","Feral; Five Domains; Free-roaming; Horses; Welfare assessment; Wild; Wildlife","adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal welfare; biologist; domestic horse; female; male; nonhuman; review; wild animal; wildlife","Kirkwood, J.K., Sainsbury, A.W., Bennett, P.M., The welfare of free-living wild animals: Methods of assessment (1994) Anim.

Here, we develop an open population spatial capture–recapture (SCR) model with sex-specific detection and population dynamics parameters to investigate population trend and sex-specific population dynamics of a capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) population in Switzerland living in eight distinct forest patches totaling 22 km2 within a region of 908 km2 and sampled via scat collection. Our model accounts for the patchy distribution of habitat and the uncertainty introduced by collecting data only every third year, while producing sex by patch population trajectories. The estimated population trajectory was a decline of 2% per year; however, the sex specificity of the model revealed a decline in the male population only, with no evidence of decline in the female population. The decline observed in males was explained by the demography of just two of the eight patches. Our study highlights the flexibility of open population SCR models for assessing population trajectories through time and across space and emphasizes the desirability of estimating sex-stratified population trends especially in species of conservation concern. © 2019 The Society of Population Ecology","open population; patchy habitat; population dynamics; spatial capture–recapture; Tetrao urogallus","demographic survey; gamebird; mark-recapture method; patchiness; population dynamics; sex-related difference; trend analysis; Switzerland; Tetrao urogallus","Augustine, B.C., (2018), https://github.com/benaug/OpenPopSCR, .

Recent advances in the field of nanomaterials such as graphene possess the significant potential benefits for both agriculture and the environment. Therefore, for promoting sustainable agriculture farmer's outlook needs to be more towards the social approach rather a technocratic approach. The purpose of this research is to examine paddy grower's perception of productive paddy farming in peninsular Malaysia. So, for this study, a sample of 74 paddy farmers had adopted to have their insights and opinions about predefined sustainable practices of farming. Altogether 86 items were factor analysed and eventually, there are five main factors, policy, namely, environmental, economic and social and communication which was acknowledged to construct a perception of sustainability by considering the sustainable agricultural practices among Malaysian paddy farmers insights were characterized mainly into three groups like low, medium and high-level insights. This was considered as the dependent variable of the ordered research model, whereas socioeconomic characteristics and communication behaviour variables were used as a variable. The results of this research model reflected that communication channels, environmental factors, socio-psychological, socioeconomic aspect, and innovation attributes education level, age, participation in farming events and productive using of knowledge the perception of sustainable farming lead to the adoption of GFT among Malaysian paddy farmers. The government should be more focused towards policy linked with the issues like illegal paddy entry, plus social elements such as increasing the level of socialization and communication between stakeholders, researchers, a scientist in the region and giving out some special programs related to farming. © 2019","Paddy growers; Parsimonious modell; Sustainable agriculture; Sustainable perception","agricultural performance; agricultural practice; alternative agriculture; fertilizer application; land use planning; paddy farming; sustainable development; Malaysia","Adnan, N., Md Nordin, S., Rahman, I., Noor, A., Adoption of green fertilizer technology among paddy farmers: a possible solution for Malaysian food security (2017) Land Use Policy, 63, pp. 38-52. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837716311024, Retrieved from; Adnan, N., Nordin, S.M., bin Abu Bakar, Z., Understanding and facilitating sustainable agricultural practice: A comprehensive analysis of adoption behaviour among Malaysian paddy farmers (2017) Land Use Policy, p. 68; Adnan, N., Nordin, S.M., Noor, A.N., A Comparative Study on GFT Adoption Behaviour Among Malaysian Paddy Farmers (2017) Green Marketing and Environmental Responsibility in Modern Corporations, pp. 239-263; Adnan, N., Nordin, S.M., Noor, A.N., A Comparative Study on Gft Adoption Behaviour Among Malaysian Paddy Farmers (2017); Adnan, N., Nordin, S.M., Noor, A.N., Segmenting Paddy Farmer's Attitude and Behavior: A Study towards the Green Fertilizer Technology Adoption Among Malaysian Paddy Farmers - Adoption of GFT (2017); Adnan, N., Nordin, S.M., Rahman, I., Vasant, P., Noor, M.A., An Overview of Electric Vehicle Technology: A Vision towards Sustainable Transportation (2017); Adnan, N., Nordin, S.M., Rahman, I., Vasant, P.M., Noor, A., A comprehensive review on theoretical framework-based electric vehicle consumer adoption research (2017) Int.

This paper complements and draws on an Innovation Summit, review of advanced biotechnologies applicable to invasive species management, and a survey of federal agencies that respond to these high-level directives. We provide an assessment of federal government capacities for the early detection of and rapid response to invasive species (EDRR) through advances in technology application; examples of emerging technologies for the detection, identification, reporting, and response to invasive species; and guidance for fostering further advancements in applicable technologies. Throughout the paper, we provide examples of how federal agencies are applying technologies to improve programmatic effectiveness and cost-efficiencies. We also highlight the outstanding technology-related needs identified by federal agencies to overcome barriers to enacting EDRR. Examples include improvements in research facility infrastructure, data mobilization across a wide range of invasive species parameters (from genetic to landscape scales), promotion of and support for filling key gaps in technological capacity (e.g., portable, field-ready devices with automated capacities), and greater investments in technology prizes and challenge competitions. © 2019, The Author(s).","Control;

However, it also suffers high levels of deforestation and degradation to meet the demands for timber extraction and agricultural activities. In Sarawak, areas designated as permanent forests account for 35.2% of the total land area, much of which have already been opened up for timber extraction. In contrast, protected areas constitute less than 7% of the land area and are mostly sparsely distributed. Forests outside these protected areas are crucial for the conservation of wildlife. For long-term wildlife conservation to be effective, attention must be focused on how logging activities are carried out and how habitats for wildlife within these logging concessions are managed. This study was carried out in a logging concession in central Sarawak where sustainable forest management is practised. The objectives were to document the composition of wildlife, their use of key habitat sites and the effects of forest disturbance. Camera trapping exercises were carried out from August 2010 to November 2011. Preliminary results indicate that older logged-over areas contained higher diversity of animal species. Overall, 32 species of terrestrial mammals and ground-dwelling birds were recorded, of which 19 species were recorded to have visited salt licks. Ungulates were recorded visiting salt licks with the highest abundance. In forests that were logged 7 years ago and left to recover, the Borneo bay cat (Catopuma badia), a globally significant species, was recorded. This result indicates the importance of sustainable forest management and suggests some of the methods logging companies can undertake to conserve wildlife in a production forest environment. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Camera trap survey; Ground-dwelling birds; Salt licks; Sarawak; Terrestrial mammals","","Bennett, E., Shebli, Z., Sarawak’s system of totally protected areas: Will it protect Sarawak’s biodiversity?

However, the measures for improving the maintenance of biodiversity and high biomass are not well evaluated. For this study, we established vegetation plots in the Anap Sustainable Development Unit (ASDU) in Bintulu, Sarawak, including the Anap-Muput Forest Management Unit (AMFMU), in order to investigate the distribution of above-ground biomass and tree species diversity. Using a Landsat image, we mapped the distribution of above-ground biomass all over the ASDU as of 2009. This distribution of above-ground biomass inside the AMFMU was not well correlated with the time that had elapsed since the last cycle of logging. The topography of the area may in fact be a more important factor. In total, 986 tree species were recorded in 70 plots (covering 8.3 ha in total). The species richness was not obviously different between recently harvested forests and primary forests, demonstrating that it is not severely affected by logging activity. As the above-ground biomass and tree species richness cannot be predicted by the years after harvesting alone, adaptive management with continuous monitoring is necessary to maintain the benefits of sustainable forest management. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Above-ground biomass; Biodiversity; Logging; Sarawak; Sustainable forest management; Tree species diversity","","Berry, N.J., Phillips, O.L., Lewis, S.L., Hill, J.K., Edwards, D.P., Tawatao, N.B., Ahmad, N., Hamer, K.C., The high value of logged tropical forests: Lessons from northern Borneo (2010) Biodiversity Conservation, 19 (4), pp. 985-997; Blackman, A., Evaluating forest conservation policies in developing countries using remote sensing data: An introduction and practical guide (2013) Forest Policy and Economics, 34, pp. 1-16; Chave, J., Spatial variation in tree species composition across tropical forests: Pattern and process (2008) Tropical Forest Community Ecology, pp. 11-30. , Walter P.

Populations of some wildlife species have decreased drastically due to landscape changes, while other species may be adapting to the new mosaic landscape. To understand the current condition of biodiversity distribution in a heterogeneous landscape, it is necessary to develop a sustainable plan for various land uses in order to maintain the rich biodiversity and preserve ecosystem services for local communities. Camera trap surveys for medium- to large-sized ground-dwelling mammals and terrestrial birds were conducted in lowland areas of Sarawak that were under different management regimes: logging concessions, land used for shifting agriculture and oil palm plantations. Using the mean trapping rate as an abundance index, the wildlife population in logging concessions seems to have recovered 4 years after harvesting. The composition of endangered or medium-sized species in secondary forests around villages in lowland areas is low, but this habitat still remains favourable for major game species for local communities. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Biodiversity; Camera trap survey; Ground-dwelling mammals; Sarawak; Sustainable forest management; Terrestrial birds","","Bennett, E.L., Nyaoi, A.J., Sompud, J., Saving Borneo’s bacon: The sustainability of hunting in Sarawak and Sabah (2000) Hunting for Sustainability in Tropical Forests, pp. 305-324. , John G.

The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is used to quantify greening, which has had largely positive trends over the last few decades using low spatial resolution satellite imagery such as AVHRR or MODIS over the pan-Arctic region. However, substantial fine scale spatial heterogeneity in the Arctic makes this large-scale investigation hard to interpret in terms of vegetation and other environmental changes. Here we focus on one area of the northern Alaskan Arctic using high spatial resolution (4 m) multispectral satellite imagery from DigitalGlobe™ to analyze the greening trend near Utqiagvik (formerly known as Barrow) over 14 years from 2002 to 2016. We found that tundra vegetation has been greening (τ = 0.65, p = 0.01, NDVI increase of 0.01 yr-1) despite no overall change in vegetation community composition. The greening is most closely correlated to the number of thawing degree days (R 2 = 0.77, F = 21.5, p &lt; 0.001) which increased in a similar linear trend over the 14 year study period (1.79 ± 0.50 days per year, p &lt; 0.01, τ =-0.56). This suggests that in this Arctic ecosystem, greening is occurring due to a lengthening growing season that appears to stimulate plant productivity without any significant change in vegetation communities. We found that vegetation communities in wetter locations greened about twice as fast as those found in drier conditions supporting the hypothesis that these communities respond more strongly to warming. We suggest that in Arctic environments, vegetation productivity may continue to rise, particularly in wet areas. © 2019 The Author(s).

Thus, proper monitoring data are inevitable for their conservation and management. Indirect monitoring through scats is frequently used for such species, but scats of related species or species with similar diet are often visually indistinguishable. Since genetic methods for species identification are time-consuming and cost-intensive, a verification of the target species beforehand would be extremely beneficial in reducing effort to the analysis of the target species only. Such species discrimination could be provided through species-specific scat detection dogs. Therefore, we evaluated the reliability of species-specific scat detection dogs for two mustelid species feeding on identical diets: the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) and the American mink (Neovison vison), both of which are conflict-laden and increasing their populations and distribution ranges in central Europe. Their scats resemble each other in morphology and odour, exacerbating the differentiation even for experts. To evaluate whether detection dogs can reliably discriminate between related species feeding on similar diets and if their use would be beneficial, we tested their abilities against those of humans. We first proved that scat characteristics are not statistically different between species. Likewise, visual species identification through people with different experience levels was only partly successful. Experts showed higher average accuracy (0.89) than non-experts (0.72 and below), but detection dogs (4 dogs) were able to discriminate otter and mink scats under laboratory conditions with an accuracy of 0.95. Moreover, otter scat detection dogs found up to four times more scat samples in the field, were twice as fast as human searchers and found an almost equal number of scats with different characteristics, while humans mostly found older and larger scats placed on hotspots. We conclude that using detection dogs for species identity will allow subsequent laboratory analyses to be species-specific and avoid spending time and money on laboratory work of the wrong species. It also provides more precise and unbiased information about the target species.

Accessing them to install monitoring equipment can be logistically challenging and dangerous. Traditional monitoring equipment is expensive and not available to many local communities. A new, low-cost method is proposed to address these challenges using a unique 3D thermal photogrammetric modelling workflow. The data acquisition and processing part of this workflow has been tested on Stromboli, a volcano in the Aeolian Islands of Italy. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were deployed at the volcano to acquire both visible and thermal infrared imagery. Both datasets were then digitally processed to produce 3D virtual outcrop models. Finally, the two datasets and models were integrated to produce the first 3D thermal photogrammetric model of an active volcano. The result is an easy-to-use workflow applicable to any volcano. This low-cost monitoring system could be deployed in developing countries and remote areas otherwise hindered by limited budgets and poor access. © 2019 The Authors.

A novel method for correcting surface temperature observations made by uncooled TIR imagers uses observations over melting snow, which provides a constant 0 °C reference temperature. This bias correction method is applied to remotely sensed surface temperature observations of forests and snow over two mountain study sites: Laret, Davos, Switzerland (27 March 2017) in the Alps, and Sagehen Creek, California, USA (21 April 2017) in the Sierra Nevada. Surface temperature retrieval errors that arise from temperature-induced instrument bias, differences in image resolution, retrieval of mixed pixels, and variable view angles were evaluated for these forest snow scenes. Applying the melting snow-based bias correction decreased the root-mean-square error by about 1 °C for retrieving snow, water, and forest canopy temperatures from airborne TIR observations. The influence of mixed pixels on surface temperature retrievals over forest snow scenes was found to depend on image resolution and the spatial distribution of forest stands. Airborne observations over the forests at Sagehen showed that near the edges of TIR images, at more than 20° from nadir, the snow surface within forest gaps smaller than 10 m was obscured by the surrounding trees. These off-nadir views, with fewer mixed pixels, could allow more accurate airborne and satellite-based observations of canopy surface temperatures. © 2019. American Geophysical Union.

However, the low quantity and quality of noninvasively collected DNA often challenge the retrieval of reliable genotypes, which may cause biases in downstream analyses. In this study, we optimized SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) genotyping of fecal samples from moose (Alces alces) with the main purpose of exploring the potential of using noninvasively retrieved genotypes for individual- and sex identification. Fecal pellets were collected during the late winter of 2016 on the Swedish island of Öland in the Baltic Sea and DNA was extracted and genotyped using 86 autosomal, six sex-specific and five species diagnostic SNPs. The SNP error rate of the quality filtered dataset was 0.06 and the probability of identity for siblings below 0.001. Following a thorough quality filtering process, 182 reliable genotypes were obtained, corresponding to 100 unique individuals (37 males, 63 females), with an estimated male proportion of 37% (± 9%). The population size, estimated using two different capture-mark-recapture approaches, was found to be in the range of 115–156 individuals (95% CI). Furthermore, moose on Öland showed significantly lower heterozygosity levels (zHexp = −5.51, N = 69, pHexp = 3.56·10−8, zHobs = −3.58, N = 69, pHobs = 3.38·10−4) and appeared genetically differentiated from moose on the Swedish mainland. Thus, we show that quality controlled noninvasively derived SNP genotypes can be highly informative for individual and population monitoring in a large ungulate. © 2019, The Author(s).","Alces alces; Capture-mark-recapture; Noninvasive sampling; Population genetics; SNP genotyping; Wildlife monitoring","","(2018), https://algdata-apps.lansstyrelsen.se/algdata-apps-stat, Accessed 2018-03-20; Allendorf, F.W., Hard, J.J., Human-induced evolution caused by unnatural selection through harvest of wild animals (2009) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 106, pp. 9987-9994; Anderson, D.R., The need to get the basics right in wildlife field studies (2001) Wildl Soc Bull (1973-2006), 29, pp. 1294-1297; Anderson, D.R., Response to Engeman: index values rarely constitute reliable information (2003) Wildl Soc Bull (1973-2006), 31, pp. 288-291; Arandjelovic, M., Head, J., Kuhl, H., Boesch, C., Robbins, M.M., Maisels, F., Vigilant, L., Effective non-invasive genetic monitoring of multiple wild western gorilla groups (2010) Biol Conserv, 143, pp. 1780-1791; Ball, M.C., Characterization of target nuclear DNA from faeces reduces technical issues associated with the assumptions of low-quality and quantity template (2007) Conserv Genet, 8, pp. 577-586; Balme, G.A., Hunter, L.T.B., Slotow, R., Evaluating methods for counting cryptic carnivores (2009) J Wildl Manag, 73, pp. 433-441; Bender, L.C., Uses of herd composition and age ratios in ungulate management (2006) Wildl Soc Bull, 34, pp. 1225-1230; Blåhed, I.-M., Königsson, H., Ericsson, G., Spong, G., Discovery of SNPs for individual identification by reduced representation sequencing of moose (Alces alces) (2018) PLOS ONE, 13 (5); Brinkman, T.J., Person, D.K., Chapin, F.S., Smith, W., Hundertmark, K.J., Estimating abundance of Sitka black-tailed deer using DNA from fecal pellets (2011) J Wildl Manag, 75, pp. 232-242; Bunnefeld, N., Keane, A., Managing wildlife for ecological, socioeconomic, and evolutionary sustainability (2014) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 111, pp. 12964-12965; Charlier, J., Laikre, L., Ryman, N., Genetic structure and evidence of a local bottleneck in moose in Sweden (2008) J Wildl Manag, 72, pp. 411-415; Creel, S., Population size estimation in Yellowstone wolves with error-prone noninvasive microsatellite genotypes (2003) Mol Ecol, 12, pp. 2003-2009; Cutler, T.L., Swann, D.E., Using remote photography in wildlife ecology: a review (1999) Wildl Soc Bull, 27, pp. 571-581; DeYoung, R.W., Demarais, S., Honeycutt, R.L., Gee, K.L., Gonzales, R.A., Social dominance and male breeding success in captive white-tailed deer (2006) Wildl Soc Bull, 34, pp. 131-136; Ericsson, G., Malmsten, J., Neumann, W., Dettki, H., Nilsson, K., Stenbacka, F., Evans, A., Singh, N., (2017) Årsrapport GPS-älgarna Öland 2016/2017; Rörelse, Reproduktion, , Institutionen för Vilt, Fisk och Miljö.

The data sources covered a range from palaeoenvironmental records and archaeological information to remote sensing and social science studies that examined human-environmental interactions and land use land cover changes (LULCC) in the region. This knowledge map of published LULCC research contributes to current debates about the drivers and dynamics of LULCC. The review aims to facilitate both multidisciplinary LULCC research and evidence-based policy analyses to improve familiarity and engagement between LULCC knowledge producers and end-users and to motivate research integration for land management policy formulation. Improving familiarity among researchers and non-academic stakeholders through the collation and synthesis of the scientific literature is among the challenges hindering policy formulation and land management decision-making by various stakeholders along the Kenya-Tanzania borderlands. Knowledge syntheses are necessary; yet, do not fully bridge the gap between knowledge and policy action. Cooperation across the science-policy interface is fundamental for the co-production of research questions by academics, policy makers and diverse stakeholders aimed at supporting land management decision making. For improved co-development and co-benefitting outcomes, the LULCC scientific community needs to mobilise knowledge for a broader audience and to advance co-development of relevant and meaningful LULCC products. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Landscape; Multidisciplinary; Policy support; Science-policy interface; Serengeti; Socio-ecological systems","archaeology; border region; decision making; historical record; interdisciplinary approach; land cover; land management; land use change; landscape planning; management practice; nature-society relations; paleoenvironment; policy making; remote sensing; Kenya; Tanzania","Abrams, L., Oral History Theory (2016), 2nd ed.

However, the impacts of urbanization on connectivity can vary among species and even populations due to differences in local landscape characteristics, and our ability to detect these relationships may depend on the spatial scale at which they are measured. Bobcats (Lynx rufus) are relatively sensitive to urbanization and the status of bobcat populations is an important indicator of connectivity in urban coastal southern California. We genotyped 271 bobcats at 13,520 SNP loci to conduct a replicated landscape resistance analysis in five genetically distinct populations. We tested urban and natural factors potentially influencing individual connectivity in each population separately, as well as study–wide. Overall, landscape genomic effects were most frequently detected at the study–wide spatial scale, with urban land cover (measured as impervious surface) having negative effects and topographic roughness having positive effects on gene flow. The negative effect of urban land cover on connectivity was also evident when populations were analyzed separately despite varying substantially in spatial area and the proportion of urban development, confirming a pervasive impact of urbanization largely independent of spatial scale. The effect of urban development was strongest in one population where stream habitat had been lost to development, suggesting that riparian corridors may help mitigate reduced connectivity in urbanizing areas. Our results demonstrate the importance of replicating landscape genetic analyses across populations and considering how landscape genetic effects may vary with spatial scale and local landscape structure. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","bobcat; connectivity; fragmentation; gene flow; landscape genomics; urbanization","animal; California; ecosystem; genetics; genotype; Lynx; physiology; population genetics; single nucleotide polymorphism; urbanization; wild animal; Animals; Animals, Wild; California; Ecosystem; Genetics, Population; Genotype; Lynx; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Urbanization","Abouelezz, H.G., Donovan, T.M., Mickey, R.M., Murdoch, J.D., Freeman, M., Royar, K., Landscape composition mediates movement and habitat selection in bobcats (Lynx rufus): Implications for conservation planning (2018) Landscape Ecology, 33, pp. 1301-1318. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-018-0654-8; Andrews, S., (2010) FastQC: A quality control tool for high throughput sequence data, , http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/, Available from; Balbi, M., Ernoult, A., Poli, P., Madec, L., Guiller, A., Martin, M.C., Petit, E.J., Functional connectivity in replicated urban landscapes in the land snail (Cornu aspersum) (2018) Molecular Ecology, 27, pp. 1357-1370; Bartoń, K., (2014) mumin: Multi–model inference.

Any landscape-level recovery requires substantial reductions in deer herds, but modern societies and wildlife management agencies appear unable to devise appropriate solutions to this chronic ecological and human health crisis. We evaluated the effectiveness of fertility control and hunting in reducing deer impacts at Cornell University. We estimated spring deer populations and planted Quercus rubra seedlings to assess deer browse pressure, rodent attack, and other factors compromising seedling performance. Oak seedlings protected in cages grew well, but deer annually browsed ≥60% of unprotected seedlings. Despite female sterilization rates of >90%, the deer population remained stable. Neither sterilization nor recreational hunting reduced deer browse rates and neither appears able to achieve reductions in deer populations or their impacts. We eliminated deer sterilization and recreational hunting in a core management area in favor of allowing volunteer archers to shoot deer over bait, including at night. This resulted in a substantial reduction in the deer population and a linear decline in browse rates as a function of spring deer abundance. Public trust stewardship of North American landscapes will require a fundamental overhaul in deer management to provide for a brighter future, and oak seedlings may be a promising metric to assess success. These changes will require intense public debate and may require new approaches such as regulated commercial hunting, natural dispersal, or intentional release of important deer predators (e.g., wolves and mountain lions). Such drastic changes in deer management will be highly controversial, and at present, likely difficult to implement in North America. However, the future of our forest ecosystems and their associated biodiversity will depend on evidence to guide change in landscape management and stewardship. © 2019 The Authors.

Urban forestry has emerged as a way of adapting natural resource management to city settings. Here we propose a research agenda for more integrative urban forestry with due consideration to forest, landscape, and ecosystem dimensions (i.e., E-L-F framework). We further offer a two-pronged pathway of emerging technologies related to assessing and understanding urban forest ecosystems. Specifically: 1) spatial-level techniques, which include assessment of forest canopy, understory, and belowground functions; and 2) organism-level techniques involving micro-, meso-, and macro- components of forests. We demonstrate this approach with an empirical case study describing China's current experience with urban forestry approaches. In China, urban forestry has developed rapidly during recent years, incorporating several fundamental principles and adopting a wide range of emerging technologies. Applying the results of this case study in China will help advance modern urban forestry across the globe, and may inspire urban forest researchers, decision makers, and practitioners. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","Ecosystem-Landscape-Forest framework; Forest City; Interdisciplinary approach; Rapid urbanization; Urban ecosystems; Urban green infrastructure","Anthropocene; forest canopy; forest ecosystem; greenspace; integrated approach; landscape ecology; resource management; urban ecosystem; urban forestry; urbanization","Agnan, Y., Séjalon-Delmas, N., Probst, A., Origin and distribution of rare earth elements in various lichen and moss species over the last century in France (2014) Sci.

We used ROV and sonar to survey threatened rockfish (Sebastes spp.) and other groundfish species associated with 18 artificial and natural reefs along the south coast of BC, Canada. Using an information-theoretic approach, we found that community composition significantly differed between natural and artificial reefs. Artificial reefs had high variability in rockfish abundance, some supporting very high or low relative abundance. Natural reefs consistently supported intermediate rockfish abundances. Groundfish diversity was significantly greater on natural reefs than artificial reefs. Depth and relief were significant predictors for both abundance and species richness. Interestingly, rockfish abundance was negatively associated with proximity to nearest rockfish conservation area. This research is a first step in understanding causal mechanisms leading to differences between fish communities on artificial reefs in our study system, and which reef attributes may facilitate successful contributions to conservation. Though artificial reefs show promise in the conservation of some threatened species, the maintenance of diverse fish communities depends on protection of heterogenous natural reef communities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial reef; Conservation; Fish habitat; Rockfish conservation; ROV; Temperate reef","Conservation; Ecosystems; Fish; Fisheries; Forestry; Information theory; Marine engineering; Remotely operated vehicles; Artificial reefs; Community composition; Conservation areas; Fish habitat; Habitat degradation; Information-theoretic approach; Relative abundance; Threatened species; Reefs; abundance; artificial reef; conservation management; conservation status; demersal fish; endangered species; habitat conservation; habitat structure; species diversity; article; British Columbia; endangered species; habitat; human; nonhuman; seashore; species richness; animal; British Columbia; coral reef; ecosystem; fish; British Columbia; Canada; Sebastes; Animals; British Columbia; Coral Reefs; Ecosystem; Fishes","Aguilera, M.A., Broitman, B.R., Thiel, M., Spatial variability in community composition on a granite breakwater versus natural rocky shores: lack of microhabitats suppresses intertidal biodiversity (2014) Mar.

In addition to the ecological and economic consequences associated with most invasive species, invasive arthropods that vector pathogens (IAVPs) to humans and animals pose substantial health risks. Species distribution models that are informed using environmental Earth data are frequently employed to predict the distribution of invasive species, and to advise targeted mitigation strategies. However, there are currently substantial mismatches in the temporal and spatial resolution of these data and the environmental contexts which affect IAVPs. Consequently, targeted actions to control invasive species or to prepare the population for possible disease outbreaks may lack efficacy. Here, we identify and discuss how the currently available environmental Earth data are lacking with respect to their applications in species distribution modeling, particularly when predicting the potential distribution of IAVPs at meaningful space-time scales. For example, we examine the issues related to interpolation of weather station data and the lack of microclimatic data relevant to the environment experienced by IAVPs. In addition, we suggest how these data gaps can be filled, including through the possible development of a dedicated open access database, where data from both remotely- and proximally-sensed sources can be stored, shared, and accessed. © 2019 by the authors.

Pollination has a major role in human food production and in maintaining flowering plant diversity. Estimating the pollination ES and its trends is thus essential for informing policy and management. However, the pollination ES remains poorly defined in practice as it is a polysemic term. In practice it is considered as: the ecosystem capacity to support pollination, the social demand for pollination or the actual pollination flow, which is the match between capacity and demand. Its quantification is complicated by the coexistence of numerous indicators. In this paper, we aimed to disentangle the diversity of definitions of the pollination service along with their associated indicators and field methods in the ecosystem service literature. From 131 reviewed papers, most studies were under temperate climate with a focus on hymenopteran pollinators, overlooking the importance of hoverflies and other dipteran pollinators. We identified four main pollination ES definitions that can be separated in two categories: (1) pollinator presence and pollen transfer, which are related to the capacity of the pollination ES; and (2) pollination success and production of fruits or seeds for human consumption, which are related to the flow of the pollination ES. Importantly, when quantified simultaneously pollination capacity and flow showed varying levels of congruence. Half of the reported relationships were congruent, but almost as many were neutral. Direct indicators of the two definitional categories characterised the respective actors of the pollination function. Studies of pollination capacity characterised pollinating agents (pollinator communities), while pollination flow studies described seeds and/or fruits produced from animal pollination. Both pollination capacity definitions share insect observations and captures as most frequent methods (70% of analysed studies), with a prevalence of indicators of pollinator diversity and abundance. Pollination flow estimation methods mainly describe the amount (number, weight) and quality of seeds/fruits. Pollinators depend on availability of feeding and nesting resources for their survival, and on their ability to reach them within landscapes. Thus, common indirect indicators of pollination are environmental variables related to semi-natural habitats and flower resources. We end this review with guidelines for relevant choices by ecosystem services scholars and practitioners of indicators and methods according to study questions and constraints (technical, financial, time and skills). Further investigations will be necessary to disentangle pollination capacity and flow relationships. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Direct indicators; Ecosystem service facet; Field methods; Indirect indicators; Pollination","Fruits; Plants (botany); Ecosystem services; Environmental variables; Estimation methods; Field methods; Flow relationship; Human consumption; Pollination; Temperate climate; Ecosystems; angiosperm; ecosystem service; estimation method; field method; plant-pollinator interaction; pollen; pollination; pollinator; Animalia; Diptera; Hexapoda; Magnoliophyta","Affek, A.N., Indicators of ecosystem potential for pollination and honey production (2017) Ecol.

The Humboldt marten (Martes caurina humboldtensis) has significantly declined throughout its historical range in coastal California and Oregon and this taxon is known from a few remnant populations. We developed a landscape habitat suitability model to identify areas of suitable habitat not yet surveyed, to provide a template for designing monitoring programs and research studies, and to inform the development of a conservation strategy. We used the results of 1,159 occupancy surveys to develop a predictive habitat model using Generalized Additive Modeling to relate Humboldt marten detections to combinations of environmental and habitat attributes hypothesized to influence marten distribution. We measured 30 candidate variables at three spatial scales, using 0.5, 1.0, and 3.0 km, and although several models were competitive, each contained the same three core variables: old growth structural index measured at the 1-km scale, serpentine habitat measured at the 3-km scale, and annual precipitation measured at the 3-km scale. The final model had an overall correct classification rate of 91% for marten detections, 82% for non-detections and a true skill statistic of 0.73. Model predictions were stable when cross-validated, with the correct classification of marten detections (89%) varying little. The largest complexes of predicted suitable habitat occurred in the areas with the three extant marten populations (north coastal California, south coastal Oregon, and central coastal Oregon), however connectivity of suitable habitat to areas outside these three areas appears limited. © 2019 by the Northwest Scientific Association.

Long-term monitoring programs across large spatial scales are required to understand how these and other factors affect wildlife populations. Occupancy models are frequently used to monitor changes in species distribution while accounting for imperfect detection. Occupancy surveys can be expensive because they typically require multiple surveys to estimate the probability of detection. Time-to-detection models provide a promising approach for estimating occupancy because they require just one visit; however, few studies have tested or applied these models to wildlife data. We ran a simulation study to assess biases of time-to-event occupancy models for standardized avian point-count surveys and then applied the models to 10 yr of data. Time to first detection occupancy models had minimal bias and almost nominal coverage for species with a mean time to first detection <8 min on surveys with 10 min of sampling. Biases and root mean squared error increased with increasing time to first detection. We applied a single species, multi-year occupancy model to 34,665 detections of 77 landbird species collected across 500 km of latitude in five protected areas along the Rocky Mountains. Models from 64 species converged and had mean times to first detection <8 min. Average time to first detections was 3.2 min, which reflected a cumulative probability of detection of 0.96. Occupancy rates increased, decreased, and remained unchanged for 53%, 9%, and 38% of species, respectively. Overall, occupancy rates increased in 2015 and 2016 for short- and long-distance migrants and decreased slightly for winter residents. Average decadal temperature and precipitation were important predictors for almost half of the species, while annual changes in spring temperature and precipitation affected 23% of species. Our studies demonstrate that time to first event occupancy models provide an efficient method for monitoring changes in distribution so long as encounter rates are much shorter than the survey duration. Our stable to increasing trends and strong responses to spring temperature and precipitation highlight the value of long-term monitoring for understanding how changing climatic conditions affect wildlife. © 2019 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.

IoT devices such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be exploited in a variety of applications related to crops management, by capturing high spatial and temporal resolution images. These technologies are expected to revolutionize agriculture, enabling decision-making in days instead of weeks, promising significant reduction in cost and increase in the yield. Such decisions enable the effective application of farm inputs, supporting the four pillars of precision agriculture, i.e., apply the right practice, at the right place, at the right time and with the right quantity. However, the actual proliferation and exploitation of UAVs in Smart Farming has not been as robust as expected mainly due to the challenges confronted when selecting and deploying the relevant technologies, including the data acquisition and image processing methods. The main problem is that still there is no standardized workflow for the use of UAVs in such applications, as it is a relatively new area. In this article, we review the most recent applications of UAVs for Precision Agriculture. We discuss the most common applications, the types of UAVs exploited and then we focus on the data acquisition methods and technologies, appointing the benefits and drawbacks of each one. We also point out the most popular processing methods of aerial imagery and discuss the outcomes of each method and the potential applications of each one in the farming operations. © 2019 by the authors.","Image processing; IoT; Precision Agriculture; Remote sensing; Review; Smart Farming; UAS; UAV; Unmanned Aerial System; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","Aerial photography; Antennas; Data acquisition; Decision making; Environmental technology; Image processing; Precision agriculture; Processing; Remote sensing; Reviews; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Agriculture applications; Emerging technologies; Environmental data; Image processing - methods; Internet of Things (IOT); Smart Farming; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Unmanned aerial systems; Internet of things","(2009) Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, , FAO: Rome, Italy; Mylonas, P., Voutos, Y., Sofou, A., A Collaborative Pilot Platform for Data Annotation and Enrichment in Viticulture (2019) Information, 10, p. 149; Mulla, D.J., Twenty five years of remote sensing in precision agriculture: Key advances and remaining knowledge gaps (2013) Biosyst.

In this study we used two methods to investigate the effect of predation risk on habitat use by the African giant pouched rat (Cricetomys sp. nov) in Ngel Nyaki forest reserve, Nigeria. The first method was ‘giving up density’ (GUD), an index of perceived risk of predation at an artificial food patch, and the second was the ‘spool-and-line’ approach, whereby unravelling spools attached to rodent bodies are used to trace their tracks. For our GUD experiment, we chose four major sites in the forest; two representative of core habitat and two at the forest edge. Additionally, three characteristic microsites were used in the GUD experiment: dense understory, open understory and near-burrows. We hypothesised that GUDs would be lower on every succeeding observation day as rats learn to use the food patches, higher GUDs would be observed in the forest edges and open microsites, and rats would show preference for the microhabitats with least exposure to potential predators. In support of our first hypothesis, we found that GUDs were highest on the first experimental nights of every session. We also found that GUDs in the forest edges were higher than GUDs in the forest core. Lower GUDs were observed close to the rat burrows and in dense understory microsites, even though these differences were not statistically significant. Tracking of rat movements using the spool-and-line method overall revealed an even use across microhabitats, with a weak preference for those with logs, dense understory or exposed ground. Overall, our results suggest that vegetation density on a microhabitat scale has little or no effect on the perception of predation risk by African giant pouched rats. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","African giant pouched rat; Afrotropical forests; Foraging; Giving up density; Predation risk","Afrotropical Region; density dependence; foraging behavior; habitat use; microhabitat; new species; perception; predation risk; recruitment (population dynamics); rodent; understory; animal experiment; article; foraging; forest; habitat use; microhabitat; Nigeria; night; nonhuman; Paleotropics; perception; predation risk; predator; rat; rodent; vegetation; animal; ecosystem; food chain; psychology; risk assessment; social environment; Cricetomys; Rattus; Rodentia; Animals; Ecosystem; Food Chain; Forests; Nigeria; Perception; Rats; Risk Assessment; Social Environment","Abu Baker, M.A., Brown, J.S., Islands of fear: effects of wooded patches on habitat suitability of the striped mouse in a South African grassland (2010) Funct.

While it has been the subject of many research projects, current approaches are often limited in the communication bandwidth (lacking context, spatial information) or interactivity (unidirectional, asynchronous) between the expert and the learner. Systems that use Mixed-Reality systems for this purpose have rigid configurations for the expert and the learner. We explore the design space of bidirectional mixed-reality telepresence systems for teaching physical tasks, and present Loki, a novel system which explores the various dimensions of this space. Loki leverages video, audio and spatial capture along with mixed-reality presentation methods to allow users to explore and annotate the local and remote environments, and record and review their own performance as well as their peer's. The system design of Loki also enables easy transitions between different configurations within the explored design space. We validate its utility through a varied set of scenarios and a qualitative user study. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).","Learning; Mixed reality; Physical tasks; Remote guidance","User interfaces; Visual communication; Communication bandwidth; Learning; Mixed reality systems; Physical tasks; Remote guidance; Remote instruction; Spatial informations; Tele-presence systems; Mixed reality","Anderson, F., Grossman, T., Matejka, J., Fitzmaurice, G., YouMove: Enhancing movement training with an augmented reality mirror (2013) Proceedings of the 26th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST '13), pp. 311-320. , https://doi.org/10.1145/2501988.2502045; Baudisch, P., Good, N., Stewart, P., Focus plus context screens: Combining display technology with visualization techniques (2001) Proceedings of the 14th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST '01), pp. 31-40. , https://doi.org/10.1145/502348.502354; Bauer, M., Heiber, T., Kortuem, G., Segall, Z., A collaborative wearable system with remote sensing (1998) Digest of Papers.

And yet there persists considerable anxiety within the management community regarding the appropriateness of environmental DNA monitoring for certain tasks and the degree to which environmental DNA methods can deliver information relevant to management needs. This brief perspective piece is an attempt to address that anxiety by offering some advice on how end-users might best approach these new technologies. I do not here review recent developments in environmental DNA science, but rather I explore ways in which managers and decision-makers might become more comfortable adopting environmental DNA tools—or choosing not to adopt them, should circumstances so dictate. I attempt to contextualize the central challenges associated with acceptance of environmental DNA detection by contrasting them with traditional “catch-and-look” approaches to biodiversity monitoring. These considerations lead me to recommend the cultivation of four “virtues,” attitudes that can be brought into engagement with environmental DNA surveillance technologies that I hope will increase the likelihood that those engagements will be positive and that the future development and application of environmental DNA tools will further the cause of wise management. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 AEHMS.","biodiversity; biosecurity; environmental DNA; surveillance","","Alberdi, A., Aizpurua, O., Gilbert, M.T.P., Bohmann, K., Mahon, A., Scrutinizing key steps for reliable metabarcoding of environmental samples (2018) Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 9, pp. 134-147; Asner, G.P., Martin, R.E., Airborne spectranomics: mapping canopy chemical and taxonomic diversity in tropical forests (2009) Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 7, pp. 269-276; Barnes, M.A., Turner, C.R., The ecology of environmental DNA and implications for conservation genetics (2015) Conservation Genetics, 17, pp. 1-17; Bicknell, A.W.J., Godley, B.J., Sheehan, E.V., Votier, S.C., Witt, M.J., Camera technology for monitoring marine biodiversity and human impact (2016) Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 14, pp. 424-432; Bohan, D.A., Vacher, C., Tamaddoni-Nezhad, A., Raybould, A., Dumbrell, A.J., Woodward, G., Next-Generation Global Biomonitoring: Large-scale, Automated Reconstruction of Ecological Networks (2017) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 32, pp. 477-487; Bohmann, K., Evans, A., Gilbert, M.T.P., Carvalho, G.R., Creer, S., Knapp, M., Yu, D.W., de Bruyn, M., Environmental DNA for wildlife biology and biodiversity monitoring (2014) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 29, pp. 358-367; Cavender-Bares, J., Meireles, J., Couture, J., Kaproth, M., Kingdon, C., Singh, A., Serbin, S., Townsend, P., Associations of Leaf Spectra with Genetic and Phylogenetic Variation in Oaks: Prospects for Remote Detection of Biodiversity (2016) Remote Sensing, 8, p. 221; Chen, W., Ficetola, G.F., Conditionally autoregressive models improve occupancy analyses of autocorrelated data: An example with environmental DNA (2019) Molecular Ecology Resources, 19, pp. 163-175; Coble, A.A., Flinders, C.A., Homyack, J.A., Penaluna, B.E., Cronn, R.C., Weitemier, K., eDNA as a tool for identifying freshwater species in sustainable forestry: A critical review and potential future applications (2019) The Science of the Total Environment, 649, pp. 1157-1170; Cristescu, M.E., Hebert, P.D.N., Uses and Misuses of Environmental DNA in Biodiversity Science and Conservation.

Iran is situated at the intersection of the distributions of the European Wildcat F. silvestris with the African Wildcat F. lybica. The genetic relationships of the Iranian wildcat population with either group remain unclear. We examined sequence variation of 1,140 bp of mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b gene from 23 wildcat samples collected across Iran. The analyses revealed two subclades, of which one is related to the Asian Wildcat (F. lybica ornata) and the other to the African Wildcat (F. lybica lybica) and the Domestic Cat (F. catus). Sixteen closely related haplotypes were identified for the entire country, with two geographically distinct subclades for western and eastern Zagros Mountain Range and overlapping in some localities. The analyses of fixation index (FST) and molecular variance (AMOVA) demonstrated significant genetic structuring among the two subclades(FST=0.63).

The Indian grey wolf, among the least studied subspecies, is a social carnivore that lives in groups called packs and has many types of vocal communication. In this study, we characterise harmonic vocalisation types of the Indian wolf using howl survey responses and opportunistic recordings from captive and nine packs (each pack contains 2–9 individuals) of free-ranging Indian wolves. Using principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering, and discriminant function analysis, we found four distinct vocalisations using 270 recorded vocalisations (Average Silhouette width Si = 0.598) which include howls and howl-barks (N = 238), whimper (N = 2), social squeak (N = 28), and whine (N = 2). Although having a smaller body size compared to other wolf subspecies, Indian wolf howls have an average mean fundamental frequency of 422 Hz (±126), which is similar to other wolf subspecies. The whimper showed the highest frequency modulation (37.296 ±4.601) and the highest mean fundamental frequency (1708±524 Hz) compared to other call types. Less information is available on the third vocalisation type, i.e. ‘Social squeak’ or ‘talking’ (Mean fundamental frequency = 461±83 Hz), which is highly variable (coefficient of frequency variation = 18.778±3.587). Lastly, we identified the whine, which had a mean fundamental frequency of 906Hz (±242) and is similar to the Italian wolf (979±109 Hz). Our study’s characterisation of the Indian wolf’s harmonic vocal repertoire provides a first step in understanding the function and contextual use of vocalisations in this social mammal. © 2019 Sadhukhan et al.

When social media users post pictures and videos of animals, near real-time data like individual identification, sex, location, or other information are made accessible to scientists. These data can help inform researchers about animal occurrence, behavior, or threats to survival. The endangered Hawaiian monk seal (Neomonachus schauinslandi) population has only 1,400 seals remaining in the wild. A small but growing population of seals has recently reestablished itself in the human-populated main Hawaiian Islands. While this population growth raises concerns about human-seal interactions it also provides the opportunity to capitalize on human observations to enhance research and conservation activities. We measured the potential utility of non-traditional data sources, in this case Instagram, to supplement current population monitoring of monk seals in the main Hawaiian Islands. We tracked all Instagram posts with the identifier #monkseal for a one-year period and assessed the photos for biological and geographical information, behavioral concerns, human disturbance and public perceptions. Social media posts were less likely to provide images suitable for individual seal identification (16.5%) than traditional sighting reports (79.9%). However, social media enhanced the ability to detect human-seal interactions or animal disturbances: 22.1%, of the 2,392 Instagram posts examined showed people within 3 meters of a seal, and 17.8% indicated a disturbance to the animal, meanwhile only 0.64% of traditional reports noted a disturbance to the animal. This project demonstrated that data obtained through social media posts have value to monk seal research and management strategies beyond traditional data collection, and further development of social media platforms as data resources is warranted. Many conservation programs may benefit from similar work using social media to supplement the research and conservation activities they are undertaking.

While the environmental components are relatively easier to measure using sensor devices, clothing value (clo) is almost impossible to visually estimate because it varies across building occupants even though they share constant thermal conditions in the same room. Therefore, in this study we developed a data-driven model to estimate the clothing insulation value as a function of skin and clothing surface temperatures. We adopted a series of environmental chamber tests with 20 participants. A portion of the collected data was used as a training dataset to establish a data-driven model based on the use of advanced computational algorithms. To consider a practical application, in this study we minimized the number of sensing points for data collection while adopting a wearable device for the user's convenience. The study results revealed that the developed predictive model generated an accuracy of 88.04%, and the accuracy became higher in the prediction of a high clo value than in that of a low value. In addition, the accuracy was affected by the user's body mass index. Therefore, this research confirms that it is possible to develop a data-driven predictive model of a user's clo value based on the use of his/her physiological and ambient environmental information, and an additional study with a larger dataset via using chamber experiments with additional test participants is required for better performance in terms of prediction accuracy. © 2019 by the authors.","Body mass index; Clothing thermal insulation; Data mining; Human factors; Human subject experiment; Thermal comfort; User-centered approach","body mass; climate conditions; climate prediction; computer simulation; data mining; environmental factor; estimation method; experimental study; insulation; perception; surface temperature","Handbook, A.F., (2009) American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, , Inc.: Atlanta, GA, USA; Tanabe, S.-I., Kobayashi, K., Nakano, J., Ozeki, Y., Konishi, M., Evaluation of thermal comfort using combined multi-node thermoregulation (65MN) and radiation models and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) (2002) Energy Build, 34, pp. 637-646; Stolwijk, J.A., (1971) A Mathematical Model of Physiological Temperature Regulation in Man, , NASA, Washington;; Fanger, P., Calculation of thermal comfort, Introduction of a basic comfort equation (1967) ASHRAE Trans, 73, pp. III41-III420; Standard, A., (2013) Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy, , ASHRAE Standard 55-2013, ASHRAE, Atlanta;; Choi, J.-H., Yeom, D., Study of data-driven thermal sensation prediction model as a function of local body skin temperatures in a built environment (2017) Build.

The last decade has seen the rise of Bayesian hierarchical models in ecology. Consequently, commonly used tools, such as the AIC, become largely inapplicable and there appears to be no consensus about a particular model selection tool that can be universally applied. We focus on a specific class of competing Bayesian spatial capture–recapture (SCR) models and apply and evaluate some of the recommended Bayesian model selection tools: (1) Bayes Factor—using (a) Gelfand-Dey and (b) harmonic mean methods, (2) Deviance Information Criterion (DIC), (3) Watanabe-Akaike's Information Criterion (WAIC) and (4) posterior predictive loss criterion. In all, we evaluate 25 variants of model selection tools in our study. We evaluate these model selection tools from the standpoint of selecting the “true” model and parameter estimation. In all, we generate 120 simulated data sets using the true model and assess the frequency with which the true model is selected and how well the tool estimates N (population size), a parameter of much importance to ecologists. We find that when information content is low in the data, no particular model selection tool can be recommended to help realize, simultaneously, both the goals of model selection and parameter estimation. But, in general (when we consider both the objectives together), we recommend the use of our application of the Bayes Factor (Gelfand-Dey with MAP approximation) for Bayesian SCR models. Our study highlights the point that although new model selection tools are emerging (e.g., WAIC) in the applied statistics literature, those tools based on sound theory even under approximation may still perform much better. © 2019 The Authors.

However, the positive impacts of their presence in terrestrial ecosystems, particularly in human-dominated landscapes, remain controversial. Limited experimental insights regarding the consequences of apex predator recoveries may be behind such controversy and may also impact on the social acceptability towards the recovery of these species. Using a quasi-experimental design and state-of-the-art density estimates, we show that mesopredator abundances were reduced after the restoration of an apex predator, with evidence of resonating positive impacts on lower trophic levels. Iberian lynx Lynx pardinus reintroduction was followed by the reduction of the abundance of mesocarnivores (red foxes Vulpes vulpes and Egyptian mongooses Herpestes ichneumon by ca. 80%) and the recovery of small game of high socio-economic value (European rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus and red-legged partridges Alectoris rufa). The observed mesopredator reduction resulted in an estimated 55.6% less rabbit consumption for the entire carnivore guild. Our findings have important implications for the social acceptability of Iberian lynx reintroductions, which crucially depend on the perception of private land owners and managers. Under certain circumstances, restoring apex predators may provide a sustainable and ethically acceptable way to reduce mesopredator abundances. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Large carnivores; Lynx pardinus; Mesopredator release; Predator control; Re-introduction; Spatial capture-recapture; Trophic cascade","abundance; biodiversity; canid; carnivore; ecosystem function; experimental design; lagomorph; landowner; predator; predator control; reintroduction; restoration ecology; trophic level; Alectoris rufa; Herpestes ichneumon; Lynx; Lynx lynx; Lynx pardinus; Oryctolagus cuniculus; Vulpes; Vulpes vulpes","Aldama, J.J., Beltrán, J.F., Delibes, M., Energy expenditure and prey requirements of free-ranging Iberian Lynx in southwestern Spain (1991) J.

This taxon was considered Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to continued habitat loss within its distribution and intense hunting pressure that contributed to population declines. However, information on population aspects and habitat use by P. jacucaca, which is fundamental for monitoring its conservation status, is not available. We studied habitat use (analysed in a Generalized Linear Model) and population density (estimated by distance sampling) in a specific area in Northeast Brazil. Using species distribution modelling (SDM), forest cover loss data (performed in the MaxEnt program) and quantitative information about hunting, more rigorous estimates of the distribution limits, available habitat, and population declines of P. jacucaca were generated. Based on the IUCN criteria, we applied analysed data to reassess the conservation status of the white-browed guan. Local density was estimated at 13.1 individuals/km2 and the estimated number of individuals removed per year due to hunting was 121.7 in the forest cover area (110.46 km2) of the Serra de Santa Catarina. Consequently, the annual removal rate of hunted individuals in the study area corresponds to approximately 11% of the population. The habitat use analysis pointed to a strong positive association with seasonally dry deciduous forest (SDDF) vegetation and with arboreal vegetation. The SDM indicated a potential distribution (climatically favourable) area of 675,823 km2, and forest cover and loss calculations indicated a total of 81,307 km2 of available suitable habitat in 2013. Therefore, comparing these results to the IUCN criteria, we recommend that P. jacucaca remain in the Vulnerable category. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","Endemic species; Hunting; Potential distribution; Threatened species; Tropical dry forest","bird; dry forest; endangered species; endemic species; habitat conservation; hunting; nature conservation; population decline; species conservation; tropical forest; Brazil; Santa Catarina; Aves; Cracidae; Penelope jacucaca","Ab'Saber, A.N., Espaços ocupados pela expansão dos climas secos na América do Sul, por ocasião dos períodos glaciais quaternários (1977), Instituto de Geografia-USP São Paulo; Araujo, H.F.P., Vieira-Filho, A.H., Cavalcanti, T.A., Barbosa, M.R.V., As aves e os ambientes em que elas ocorrem em uma reserva particular no Cariri paraibano, nordeste do Brasil (2012) Revista Brasileira de Ornitologia, 20, pp. 365-377; Araújo, C.B., Marcondes-Machado, L.O., Costa, G.C., The importance of biotic interactions in species distribution models: A test of the Eltonian noise hypothesis using parrots (2014) Journal of Biogeography, 41, pp. 513-523; Banda-R, K., Delgado-Salinas, A., Dexter, K.G., Plant diversity patterns in neotropical dry forests and their conservation implications (2016) Science, 353, p. 1387; Bardeli, R., Wolff, D., Kurth, F., Koch, M., Tauchert, K.H., Frommolt, K.H., Detecting bird sounds in a complex acoustic environment and application to bioacoustic monitoring (2010) Pattern Recognition Letters, 31, pp. 1524-1534; Begazo, A.J., Bodmer, R.E., Use and conservation of Cracidae (Aves: Galliformes) in the peruvian amazon (1998) Oryx, 32, pp. 301-309; Bertch, C., Barreto, G.R., Abundancia y área de acción del Paují de Copete (Crax daubentoni) en los llanos centrales de Venezuela (2008) Ornitologia Neotropical, 19, pp. 287-293; Bernardo, C.S., Rubim, P., Bueno, R.S., Begotti, R.A., Meirelles, F., Donatti, C.I., Galetti, M., Density estimates of the black-fronted piping guan in the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest (2011) The Wilson Journal of Ornithology, 123, pp. 690-698; Bezerra, D.M.M., Araujo, H.F.P., Alves, R.R.N., Understanding the use of wild birds in a priorityconservation area of Caatinga, a Brazilian tropical dry forest (2019) Environment, Development and Sustainability; BirdLife International, Penelope Jacucaca.

Recent advances focus on treating symptoms, not preventing future cases. We therefore explored the epidemiology of this syndrome through an analysis of husbandry and veterinary conditions of 63 Andean bears (26M:37F) housed in North and South American zoos and other ex situ circumstances. We had the most complete information for the North American population and found that 29% of females (n = 24) were affected. No males (n = 26) were affected. An analysis of generalized linear models indicated that three models were competitive in describing the occurrence of the condition (i.e., ΔAICc ≤ 2): the model including only the individual's sex (χ2 = 13.41, df = 1, p '.001), the model including both individual sex and social housing status (χ2 = 1.36, df = 2, p '.001), and the model including both individual sex and the expression of stereotypical behaviors (χ2 = 13.82, df = 2, p =.001). Stereotypical behaviors were common among both males (50%, n = 26) and females (51.9%, n = 27) whether or not they were affected, but the syndrome was seen only in females who had been socially housed. Therefore, we suggest that the Andean bear alopecia syndrome is a symptomatic response to the long-term social housing of bears that would otherwise not live socially. To prevent new cases, we recommend that female Andean bears be housed with adult conspecifics only when females choose to cohabitate. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","alopecia; captivity; epidemiology; ex situ; Tremarctos ornatus","alopecia; animal; animal housing; animal husbandry; bear; female; male; North America; South America; veterinary medicine; zoo animal; Alopecia; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Animals, Zoo; Female; Housing, Animal; Male; North America; South America; Ursidae","Alroy, J., Limits to captive breeding of mammals in zoos (2015) Conservation Biology, 29, pp. 926-931; Appleton, R.D., Van Horn, R.C., Noyce, K.V., Spady, T.J., Swaisgood, R.R., Arcese, P., Phenotypic plasticity in the timing of reproduction in Andean bears (2018) Journal of Zoology, 305, pp. 196-202. , https://doi.org/10.1111/jzo.12553; Aquilina, G.D., Stimulation of maternal behaviour in the Spectacled bear at Buffalo Zoo (1981) International Zoo Yearbook, 21, pp. 143-145; Blake, C.N., Collins, D., Captive ursids: Results and selected findings of a multi-institutional survey (2002) In Proceedings of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians, pp. 28-30; Bloxam, Q., Breeding the spectacled bear Tremarctos ornatus at Jersey Zoo (1977) International Zoo Yearbook, 17, pp. 158-161; Bonier, F., Martin, P.R., Wingfield, J.C., Maternal corticosteroids influence primary offspring sex ratio in a free-ranging passerine bird (2007) Behavioral Ecology, 18, pp. 1045-1050. , https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arm075; Borbón-García, A., Reyes, A., Vives-Flórez, M., Caballero, S., Captivity shapes the gut microbiota of Andean bears: Insights into health surveillance (2017) Frontiers in Microbiology, 8, p. 1316. , https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01316; Bowkett, A.E., Ex situ conservation planning is more complicated than prioritizing the keeping of threatened species in zoos (2014) Animal Conservation, 17, pp. 101-103. , https://doi.org/10.1111/acv.12116; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (2002) Model selection and multimodel inference: A practical information-theoretic approach, , 2nd ed, New York, NY, Springer Science + Business Media; Cameron, E.Z., Facultative adjustment of mammalian sex ratios in support of the Trivers-Willard hypothesis: Evidence for a mechanism (2004) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

Haemadipsids have been shown to retain high-quality host DNA in their guts on the order of months and have been targeted as tools for vertebrate biodiversity assessment in tropical rainforests, where species are difficult to monitor. Complementing prior mammal-specific 16S mtDNA data, the 12S mtDNA locus optimized for tetrapods was employed to assign identities to leech hosts. Through traditional Sanger sequencing of each blood meal for each of 16S and 12S mitochondrial regions, we find a 41% increase in the diversity of taxa detected using both loci than of using 16S alone. In addition to mammalian diversity assigned through sequencing of 16S, the host identities determined through sequencing of both loci inform the diversity of sampled localities as well as the foraging behavior of the leeches themselves. We present evidence for generalist foraging among the terrestrial leeches of Madagascar (Chtonobdella fallax), with data suggesting mammals, birds, amphibians, and reptiles as viable leech hosts. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Biodiversity; Conservation; iDNA; Leech; Madagascar","","Blanchard, R., Monographie des hémadipsines (sangsues terrestres) (1917) Bull Soc Pathol Exot, 10, pp. 640-675; Borda, E., A Revision of the Malagabdellinae (arhynchobdellida: Domanibdellidae), with a Description of a New Species, Malagabdella niarchosorum, from Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar (2006) American Museum Novitates, 3531 (1), p. 1; Borda, E., Oceguera-Figueroa, A., Siddall, M.E., On the classification, evolution and biogeography of terrestrial haemadipsoid leeches (Hirudinida: Arhynchobdellida: Hirudiniformes) (2007) Mol Phylogenet Evol, 46, pp. 142-154; Brooks, T.M., Mittermeier, R.A., Mittermeier, C.G., da Fonseca, G.A.B., Rylands, A.B., Konstant, W.R., Flick, P., Hilton-Taylor, C., Habitat loss and extinction in the hotspots of biodiversity (2002) Conserv Biol, 16, pp. 909-923; Calvignac-Spencer, S., Merkel, K., Kutzner, N., Kühl, H., Boesch, C., Kappeler, P.M., Metzger, S., Leendertz, F.H., Carrion fly-derived DNA as a tool for comprehensive and cost-effective assessment of mammalian biodiversity (2013) Mol Ecol, 22, pp. 915-924; Caragiulo, A., Dias-Freedman, I., Clark, J.A., Rabinowitz, S., Amato, G., Mitochondrial DNA sequence variation and phylogeography of Neotropic pumas (Puma concolor) (2013) Mitochondrial DNA, 25 (4), pp. 304-312; Drinkwater, R., Schnell, I.B., Bohmann, K., Bernard, H., Veron, G., Clare, E., Gilbert, M.T.P., Rossiter, S.J., Using metabarcoding to compare the suitability of two blood-feeding leech species for sampling mammalian diversity in North Borneo (2019) Mol Ecol Resour, 19, pp. 105-117; Dunham, A.E., Erhart, E.M., Overdorff, D.J., Wright, P.C., Evaluating effects of deforestation, hunting, and El Niño events on a threatened lemur (2008) Biol Conserv, 141, pp. 287-297; Dunham, A.E., Erhart, E.M., Wright, P.C., Global climate cycles and cyclones: consequences for rainfall patterns and lemur reproduction in southeastern Madagascar (2011) Glob Chang Biol, 17, pp. 219-227; Eaton, M.J., Meyers, G.L., Kolokotronis, S.O., Leslie, M.S., Martin, A.P., Amato, G., Barcoding bushmeat: molecular identification of Central African and South American harvested vertebrates (2010) Conserv Genet, 11, pp. 1389-1404; Edgar, R.C., MUSCLE: multiple sequence alignment with high accuracy and high throughput (2004) Nucleic Acids Res, 32, pp. 1792-1797; Farris, Z.J., Gerber, B.D., Valenta, K., Rafaliarison, R., Razafimahaimodison, J.C., Larney, E., Rajaonarivelo, T., Chapman, C.A., Threats to a rainforest carnivore community: a multi-year assessment of occupancy and co-occurrence in Madagascar (2017) Biol Conserv, 210, pp. 116-124; Folmer, O., Black, M., Hoeh, W., DNA primers for amplification of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I from diverse metazoan invertebrates (1994) Mol Mar Biol Biotechnol, 3, pp. 294-299. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DyaK2MXjt12gtLs%3D, PID: 7881515; Francl, K.E., Schnell, G.D., (2002) Environmental Monitoring and Assessment, 73 (1), pp. 67-93; Ganzhorn, J.U., Lowry, P.P., Schatz, G.E., Sommer, S., The biodiversity of Madagascar: one of the world’s hottest hotspots on its way out (2001) ORYX., 35, pp. 346-348; Gardner, C.J., Jasper, L., (2018) Miscellaneous behavioural observations of Malagasy birds.

We found large mammal communities were by far the most heavily impacted by land-use change, with areas of attempted large wildlife exclusion and intense livestock grazing, respectively, containing 164 and 165 million fewer years of evolutionary history than conserved areas (~40% declines). The effects of land-use change on PD varied substantially across taxa, type of land-use change, and, for most groups, also across abiotic conditions. This highlights the need for taxa-specific or multi-taxa evaluations, for managers interested in conserving specific groups or whole communities, respectively. It also suggests that efforts to conserve and restore PD may be most successful if they focus on areas of particular land-use types and abiotic conditions. Importantly, we also describe the substantial species turnover and compositional changes that cannot be detected by alpha diversity metrics, emphasizing that neither PD nor other taxonomic diversity metrics are sufficient proxies for ecological integrity. Finally, our results provide further support for the emerging consensus that conserved landscapes are critical to support intact assemblages of some lineages such as large mammals, but that mosaics of disturbed land-uses, including both agricultural and pastoral land, do provide important habitats for a diverse array of plants and small mammals. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America","Africa;

This paper reviews fragmentation trends – historical and current – in China, the fourth largest country on Earth, and explores its consequences. Remote sensing makes it possible to track land-use change at a global scale and monitor fragmentation of dwindling natural landscapes. Yet few studies have linked fragmentation mapped remotely with impacts on biodiversity within human-modified landscapes. Recent reforestation programs have caused substantial increases in forest cover but have not stopped fragmentation, because the new forests are mostly monocultures that further fragment China's remnant old-growth lowland forests that harbour the highest levels of biodiversity. Fragmentation – and associated biodiversity declines – is unevenly distributed in China's forests, being most problematic where agricultural expansion is occurring in the southwest and northeast, serious in the densely populated eastern regions where urbanisation and transport infrastructure are modifying landscapes, but less of a problem in other regions. Analyses of temporal trends show that the drivers of forest fragmentation are shifting from mainly agricultural expansion to urbanisation and infrastructure development. Most of China's old-growth forests persist in small, isolated fragments from which many native species have disappeared, on land unsuitable for human utilisation. Fragmentation throughout China is likely to have major consequences on biodiversity conservation, but few studies have considered these large-scale processes at the national level. Our review fills this research gap and puts forward a systematic perspective relevant to China and beyond. © 2019 Cambridge Philosophical Society","deforestation; land-use history; mean patch size; new forests; reforestation; spatiotemporal dynamics","","Abdullah, S.A., Nakagoshi, N., Forest fragmentation and its correlation to human land use change in the state of Selangor, peninsular Malaysia (2007) Forest Ecology and Management, 241, pp. 39-48; Arroyo-Rodríguez, V., Melo, F.P.L., Martínez-Ramos, M., Bongers, F., Chazdon, R.L., Meave, J.A., Norden, N., Tabarelli, M., Multiple successional pathways in human-modified tropical landscapes: new insights from forest succession, forest fragmentation and landscape ecology research (2017) Biological Reviews, 92, pp. 326-340; Ascensão, F., Fahrig, L., Clevenger, A.P., Corlett, R.T., Jaeger, J.A.G., Laurance, W.F., Pereira, H.M., Environmental challenges for the belt and road initiative (2018) Nature Sustainability, 1, pp. 206-209; Asner, G.P., Rudel, T.K., Aide, T.M., Defries, R., Emerson, R., A contemporary assessment of change in humid tropical forests (2009) Conservation Biology, 23, pp. 1386-1395; Aziz, S.A., Laurance, W.F., Clements, R., Forests reserved for rubber?

Problems of surveying Andean Condor populations using traditional survey methods are particularly acute in Bolivia, largely because only few roosts are known there. However, similar to other vulture species, Andean Condors aggregate at animal carcasses, and are individually recognizable due to unique morphological characteristics (size and shape of male crests and pattern of wing coloration). This provided us with an opportunity to use a capture-recapture (‘sighting-resighting’) modelling framework to estimate the size and structure of an Andean Condor population in Bolivia using photographs of individuals taken at observer-established feeding stations. Between July and December 2014, 28 feeding stations were established in five different zones throughout the eastern Andean region of Bolivia, where perched and flying Andean Condors were photographed. Between one and 57 (mean = 20.2 ± 14.6 sd) Andean Condors were recorded visiting each feeding station and we were able to identify 456 different individuals, comprising 134 adult males, 40 sub-adult males, 79 juvenile males, 80 adult females, 30 sub-adult females and 93 juvenile females. Open population capture-recapture models produced population estimates ranging from 52 ± 14 (se) individuals to 678 ± 269 individuals across the five zones, giving a total of 1388 ± 413 sd individuals, which is roughly 20% of the estimated Andean Condor global population. Future trials of this method need to consider explicitly knowledge of Andean Condor movements and home-ranges, habitat preferences when selecting suitable sites as feeding stations, juvenile movements and other behaviours. Sighting-resighting methods have considerable potential to increase the accuracy of surveys of Andean Condors and other bird species with unique individual morphological characteristics. © 2018 The Authors Ibis published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Ornithologists’ Union","capture–recapture; feeding stations; field photography; Neotropical vultures; sighting-resighting; unique plumage characteristics","aggregation behavior; demographic survey; feeding ground; field method; mark-recapture method; Neotropical Region; photogrammetry; plumage; population decline; population size; raptor; Animalia; Aves; Vultur gryphus","Alarcón, P., Lambertucci, S., Morales, J.M., Wiemeyer, G., Mastrantuoni, O., Shepard, E., Sánchez-Zapata, J.A., Donázar, J.A., La ecología del movimiento: tras los pasos del cóndor andino (2013) Desde Patagon., 10, pp. 2-10. , &amp; Alcaide, M., Cadahía, L., Lambertucci, S.A., Negro, J.J., Noninvasive estimation of minimum population sizes and variability of the major histocompatibility complex in the Andean Condor (2010) Condor, 112, pp. 470-478. , &amp; Amstrup, S.C., McDonald, T.L., Stirling, I., Polar bears in the Beaufort Sea: a 30-year mark-recapture case history (2001) J.

Ecologists are interested in non-intrusive census of these wild felines. In this paper, a method for automatic identification of specific individuals among ocelots is proposed. The proposed method maps each spot to the ellipse that best fits the spot, then keeps only the center of the ellipse and a vector that shows the orientation of the ellipse. Each animal is then characterized by a set of dots and associated vectors, just as human fingerprints are characterized after minutiae has been extracted. The proposed technique identifies individual ocelots by searching for local structures in the corresponding set of dots and associated vectors. According to the experiments, the proposed method outperforms Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Speed Up Robust Feature (SURF), and Oriented fast and Rotated Brief (ORB) based identification systems in the ocelot identification problem. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Contour closing; Ellipse fitting; Minutiae matching; Ocelot identification","Automation; Automatic identification; Contour closing; Ellipse fitting; Identification problem; Local structure; Minutiae matching; Oriented fast and rotated brief (ORB); Scale invariant feature transforms; Geometry","Bay, H., Ess, A., Tuytelaars, T., Van Gool, L., Speeded-up robust features (surf) (2008) Comput Vis Image Underst, 110 (3), pp. 346-359; Bolger, D.T., Morrison, T.A., Vance, B., Lee, D., Farid, H., A computer-assisted system for photographic mark–recapture analysis (2012) Methods Ecol Evol, 3 (5), pp. 813-822; Charre-Medellin, J.F., Monterrubio-Rico, T.C., Botello, F.J., León-Paniagua, L., Núñez, R., First records of jaguar (panthera onca) from the state of michoacán, méxico (2013) Southwest Nat, 58 (2), pp. 264-268; Fawcett, T., An introduction to roc analysis (2006) Pattern Recogn Lett, 27 (8), pp. 861-874; Figueroa, K., Camarena, J.A., Garcìa, J., Tejeda, H., Fast automatic detection of wildlife in images from trap cameras (2014) Iberoamerican Congress on Pattern Recognition (CIARP), 8827, pp. 940-947; Figueroa, K., Castro, A., Camarena-Ibarrola, A., Tejeda, H., Feature extraction as ellipse of wild-life images (2016) 8Th Mexican Conference on Pattern Recognition, pp. 23-32. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-39393-3_3; Foster, R.J., Harmen, B.J., A critique of density estimation from camera-trap data (2011) The Journal of Wildlife Management; Gauthier-Clerc, M., Gendner, J.P., Ribic, C.A., Fraser, W.R., Woehler, E.J., Descamps, S., Gilly, C., Le Maho, Y., Long-term effects of flipper bands on penguins (2004) Proc R Soc Lond Ser B-Biol Science, 271, pp. S423-S426; Hartog, J., Reijns, R., (2014) I3 S Pattern Manual.

We investigated the effects of fragmentation on reproductive biology in nine populations of the rare taxon Banksia nivea subsp. uliginosa, differing in size and habitat context. Small mammals were the main pollinator, with lower contributions from honeybees and birds (honeyeaters). There was no significant relationship between population size, fruit set and seed germinability. Fruit set was marginally highest (25.5 ± 3.4) in medium size populations and was variable over years. Lower fruit set (1.0 ± 0.6) in the smallest population may be due to inbreeding depression or lack of pollinators in a degraded habitat, but low fruit set was also observed in the largest population despite high levels of gene flow, possibly due to low pollinator visitation rate in a low-density population. Seeds from all populations had high germination success (>93.4%). Predation occurred in up to 56% of fruit and increased with increasing population size, but was not significantly different between populations of different size. Our study provided evidence that the reproductive output in species in a naturally fragmented landscape system may be resilient to reduced population size and other influences of anthropogenic fragmentation. © 2019 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society.","heathland; pollination; seed predation; seed set","bird; fruit set; germination; habitat fragmentation; heathland; honeybee; plant-pollinator interaction; pollination; population size; reproductive success; seed predation; seed set; shrub; small mammal; Aves; Banksia; Mammalia; Meliphagidae; Proteaceae","Adler, L.S., Irwin, R.E., Comparison of pollen transfer dynamics by multiple floral visitors: Experiments with pollen and fluorescent dye (2006) Annals of Botany, 97, pp. 141-150; Aguilar, R., Ashworth, L., Galetto, L., Aizen, M.A., Plant reproductive susceptibility to habitat fragmentation: Review and synthesis through a meta-analysis (2006) Ecology Letters, 9, pp. 968-980; Aizen, M.A., Ashworth, L., Galetto, L., Reproductive success in fragmented habitats: Do compatibility systems and pollination specialization matter?

Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite imagery provide an effective dataset for large scale surveys. Convolutional Neural Networks have successfully been employed to analyze such imagery and detect large animals. As the datasets increase in volume, O(TB), and number of images, O(1k), utilizing High Performance Computing (HPC) resources becomes necessary. In this paper, we investigate a task-parallel data-driven workflows design to support imagery analysis pipelines with heterogeneous tasks on HPC. We analyze the capabilities of each design when processing a dataset of 3,000 VHR satellite images for a total of 4~TB. We experimentally model the execution time of the tasks of the image processing pipeline.

A limited number of studies have addressed the coupling of wetland and urban dynamics, but this relationship remains unclear. In this study, a time-varying methodology of predicting wetland distribution was developed to support decision-making. The novelty of the methodology is its ability to dynamically simulate wetland shrinkage together with urban expansion and reveal conflicts and potential tradeoffs under different scenarios. The developed methodology consists of three modules: a historical change detection of wetland and urban areas module, a spatial urban sprawl simulation and forecasting module that can accommodate different development priorities, and a wetland distribution module with time-varying logistic regression. The methodology was applied and tested in the TonghuWetland as a case study. The wetland and urban extents presented a spatially intersecting shift, where wetlands lost more than 40% of their area from 1977 to 2017, while urban areas expanded by 10-fold, threatening wetlands. The increase in the relative importance metric of the time-varying regression model indicated an enhanced influence of urban expansion on the wetland. An accuracy assessment validated a robust statistical result and a good visual fit between spatially distributed wetland occurrence probabilities and the actual distribution of wetland. Incorporating the new variable of urban expansion improved modeling performance and, particularly, realized a greater ability to predict potential wetland loss than provided by the traditional method. Future wetland loss probabilities were visualized under different scenarios. The historical trend scenario predicted continuously expanding urban growth and wetland shrinkage to 2030. However, a specific urban development strategy scenario was designed interactively to control the potential wetland loss. Consideration of such scenarios can facilitate identifying tradeoffs to support wetland conservation. © 2019 by the authors.","Dynamic model; Intersecting process; Tradeoff analysis; Urban expansion; Wetland loss","decision making; development project; environmental degradation; environmental modeling; habitat loss; methodology; temporal analysis; trade-off; urban area; urban sprawl; wetland; Beijing [China]; China; Tonghui River","Zedler, J.B., Kercher, S., Wetland resources: Status, trends, ecosystem services, and restorability (2005) Annu Rev.

In South Carolina, USA, where there has been growth in black bear populations and bear–human-conflict reports during the past several decades, managers need robust estimates of population size to inform management strategies. We used maximum-likelihood capture–recapture models, using hair snares to collect DNA samples, to estimate density and abundance for a harvested population of black bear in northwestern South Carolina during 2013 to 2014. Models were tested in a spatially explicit framework using the secr package in Program R. Black bear density was estimated at 0.133 bears/km2 (SE = 0.034) in 2013 and 0.179 bears/km2 (SE = 0.043) in 2014. Black bear abundance in our study area was estimated to be 586 bears (SE = 95) in 2013 and 680 bears (SE = 128) in 2014, which are 2–3-fold lower than previous estimates. We suggest that these estimates be considered a baseline for state biologists to employ in the population's management and in developing future harvest-regulation strategies. Overall our study highlighted the potential for model choice to influence density estimates, and we concluded that spatially explicit models were appropriate for this study because geographic closure could not be assumed. © 2019 The Wildlife Society. © 2019 The Wildlife Society","abundance; black bear; density; hair snare; South Carolina; spatially explicit capture–recapture; Ursus americanus","abundance estimation; baseline conditions; bear; DNA; mark-recapture method; maximum likelihood analysis; population density; population size; wildlife management; South Carolina; United States; Ursus americanus","Azad, S., Wactor, T., Jachowski, D., Demographic trends of a harvested American black bear population in northwestern South Carolina (2017) Ursus, 28, pp. 56-65; Azad, S., Wactor, T., Jachowski, D., Relationship of acorn mast production to black bear population growth rates and human–bear interactions in northwestern South Carolina (2017) Southeastern Naturalist, 16, pp. 235-251; Borchers, D.L., Efford, M.G., Spatially explicit maximum likelihood methods for capture–recapture studies (2008) Biometrics, 64, pp. 377-385; Bowman, J.L., Leopold, B.D., Vilella, F.J., Gill, D.A., Jacobson, H.A., Attitudes of landowners toward American black bears compared between areas of high and low bear populations (2001) Ursus, 12, pp. 153-160; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D., (2003) Model selection and multi-model inference: a practical information-theoretic approach, , Second edition, Springer, New York, New York, USA; Butfiloski, J.W., (1996), Home range, movementshabitat utilization of female black bears in the mountains of South Carolina.

For birds in particular, survey methods have been tested extensively using point counts and sound recording surveys. Here, we review the latest evidence for this taxon within the frame of a systematic map. We compare sampling effectiveness of these two survey methods, the output variables they produce, and their practicality. When assessed against the standard of point counts, autonomous sound recording proves to be a powerful tool that samples at least as many species. This technology can monitor birds in an exhaustive, standardized, and verifiable way. Moreover, sound recorders give access to entire soundscapes from which new data types can be derived (vocal activity, acoustic indices). Variables such as abundance, density, occupancy, or species richness can be obtained to yield data sets that are comparable to and compatible with point counts. Finally, autonomous sound recorders allow investigations at high temporal and spatial resolution and coverage, which are more cost effective and cannot be achieved by human observations alone, even though small-scale studies might be more cost effective when carried out with point counts. Sound recorders can be deployed in many places, they are more scalable and reliable, making them the better choice for bird surveys in an increasingly data-driven time. We provide an overview of currently available recorders and discuss their specifications to guide future study designs. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America","acoustic recording; autonomous recording units; bioacoustics; passive acoustic monitoring; point count; sound recorders","bioacoustics; bird; detection method; instrumentation; observational method; sampling; spatial resolution; species richness; survey method; Animalia; Aves; acoustics; animal; bird; human; sound; sound detection; vocalization; Acoustics; Animals; Birds; Humans; Sound; Sound Spectrography; Vocalization, Animal","Abrahams, C., Bird bioacoustic surveys—developing a standard protocol (2018) In Practice, 102, pp. 20-23; Abrahams, C., Comparison between lek counts and bioacoustic recording for monitoring Western Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus L.)

In contrast to electroencephalography (EEG) and actigraphy, videography is a cost-effective and non-invasive method to study sleep architecture in animals. With video data, however, it is challenging to score subtle changes that occur in different sleep states, and technology has lagged behind innovations in EEG and actigraphy. Here, we applied Eulerian videography to magnify pixels relevant to scoring sleep from video, and then compared these results to analyses based on actigraphy and standard infrared videography. We studied four species of lemurs (Eulemur coronatus, Lemur catta, Propithecus coquereli, Varecia rubra) for 12-h periods per night, resulting in 6480 1-min epochs for analysis. Cramer’s V correlation between actigraphy-classified sleep and infrared videography-classified sleep revealed consistent results in eight of the nine 12-h videos scored. A sample of the infrared videography was then processed by Eulerian videography for movement magnification and re-coded. A second Cramer’s V correlation analysis, between two independent scorers coding the same Eulerian-processed video, found that interobserver agreement among Eulerian videography increased sleep vs. awake, NREM, and REM classifications by 7.1%, 46.7%, and 34.3%, respectively. Furthermore, Eulerian videography was more strongly correlated with actigraphy data when compared to results from standard infrared videography.

Such a bias is problematic, also, for population estimation using mark-recapture models that assume homogeneity in detection probabilities. In this study, we investigated whether differences in boldness result in differences in detection probability in a native Australian rodent, the grassland melomys (Melomys burtoni). During a mark-recapture study of this species, we used modified open field tests to assess the boldness (via emergence, and interaction with a novel object) of melomys trapped on the last night of four trapping nights in each of two trapping sessions. Despite melomys showing repeatable variation in these behavioural traits, neither boldness nor emergence latency had an effect on detection probability, and we found no evidence that detection probability varied between individuals. This result suggests that any neophobia is experienced and resolved in individuals of this species on a scale of minutes, rather than the hours across which traps are made available each night. Our work demonstrates that personality-caused sampling bias may not be inevitable, even in situations where animals are required to respond to novelty to be detected, such as in baited traps. Heterogeneity in personality does not inevitably lead to heterogeneity in detection probability. Significance statement: Historically, passive traps were assumed a non-biased means of sampling animal populations. Increasingly behavioural ecologists suggest that personality traits, particularly individual boldness, may influence behaviour and, as a consequence, could result in sampling bias. Here, we present a comprehensive example of when animal personality has no effect on detection probability. Despite having distinct personalities, detection probabilities of a native Australian rodent, grassland melomys Melomys burtoni, were not influenced by whether they were ‘shy’ or ‘bold’. We provide evidence that heterogeneity in personality does not inevitably lead to heterogeneity in detection probability. Given that population estimation models typically assume homogeneity in detection probability between individuals, if this is a broad phenomenon, consistently similar results may improve our confidence in this assumption. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Boldness; Detection heterogeneity; Neophobia; Open field test; Sampling bias","emergence; heterogeneity; neophobia; open space; population estimation; population modeling; rodent; sampling bias; testing method; Animalia; Melomys; Melomys burtoni; Rodentia","Arakawa, H., Cruz, S., Deak, T., From models to mechanisms: odorant communication as a key determinant of social behavior in rodents during illness-associated states (2011) Neurosci Biobehav Rev, 35, pp. 1916-1928; Begg, R., Walsh, B., Woerle, F., King, S., Ecology of Melomys burtoni, the grassland Melomys (Rodentia: Muridae) at Cobourg Peninsula, N.T (1983) Wildl Res, 10, pp. 259-267; Bell, A.M., Hankison, S.J., Laskowski, K.L., The repeatability of behaviour: a meta-analysis (2009) Anim Behav, 77, pp. 771-783; Biro, P.A., Are most samples of animals systematically biased?

To collect data over large spatial and temporal extents for such inferences, especially for species with low densities or wide distributions, citizen science can be an efficient approach. Integrated models have also emerged as an important methodology to estimate population parameters by combining multiple types of data, including citizen science data. We developed a spatially explicit integrated model that combines opportunistically collected presence–absence (PA) data, commonly collected in citizen science efforts, with systematically collected spatial capture–recapture (SCR) data, which are often limited to small spatial and temporal extents. We conducted single and multi-season simulations with parameters informed by North American black bear (Ursus americanus) populations, to evaluate the influence of varying amounts of opportunistic PA data collected at larger spatial and temporal extents on the estimation of population-level parameters. Integrating opportunistic PA data increased the precision and accuracy of posterior estimates of abundance, and survival and recruitment rates. In some cases, adding PA locations improved abundance estimates more than increasing PA detection probability. Posterior estimates were as precise and unbiased as when higher quality, but sparse, SCR data were available. We also applied the integrated model to SCR and citizen science PA data collected on black bears in New York, with results consistent with our simulations. Our findings indicate that citizen science in integrated models can be a cost-efficient way to improve estimates of population parameters and increase the spatiotemporal extent of inference. Continued developments with integrated models and citizen science data will offer additional ways to improve our understanding of population structure and demographics. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America","black bear; citizen science; integrated population model; occupancy; opportunistic; presence–absence; recruitment; spatial capture–recapture; survival","abundance; bear; conservation management; conservation status; data set; demography; ecological modeling; mark-recapture method; population distribution; population modeling; population structure; recruitment (population dynamics); survival; New York [United States]; United States; Ursus americanus; animal; bear; demography; ecology; New York; population density; Animals; Citizen Science; Demography; Ecology; New York; Population Density; Ursidae","Abadi, F., Gimenez, O., Arlettaz, R., Schaub, M., An assessment of integrated population models: bias, accuracy, and violation of the assumption of independence (2010) Ecology, 91, pp. 7-14; Augustine, B.C., Royle, J.A., Murphy, S.M., Candler, R.B., Cox, J.J., Kelly, M.J., Spatial capture-recapture for categorically marked populations with an application to genetic capture-recapture (2019) Ecosphere, 10; Bailey, L.L., Hines, J.E., Nichols, J.D., MacKenzie, D.I., Sampling design trade-offs in occupancy studies with imperfect detection: examples and software (2007) Ecological Applications, 17, pp. 281-290; Beissinger, S.R., Westphal, M.I., On the use of demographic models of population viability in endangered species management (1998) Journal of Wildlife Management, 62, pp. 821-841; Besbeas, P., Freeman, S.N., Morgan, B.J.T., Catchpole, E.A., Integrating mark–recapture–recovery and census data to estimate animal abundance and demographic parameters (2002) Biometrics, 58, pp. 540-547; Beston, J.A., Variation in life history and demography of the American black bear (2011) The Journal of Wildlife Management, 75, pp. 1588-1596; Blanc, L., Marboutin, E., Gatti, S., Zimmermann, F., Gimenez, O., Improving abundance estimation by combining capture–recapture and occupancy data: example with a large carnivore (2014) Journal of Applied Ecology, 51, pp. 1733-1739; Bonney, R., Cooper, C.B., Dickinson, J., Kelling, S., Phillips, T., Rosenberg, K.V., Shirk, J., Citizen science: a developing tool for expanding science knowledge and scientific literacy (2009) BioScience, 59, pp. 977-984; Borchers, D.L., Efford, M.G., Spatially explicit maximum likelihood methods for capture-recapture studies (2008) Biometrics, 64, pp. 377-385; Bradter, U., Mair, L., Jönsson, M., Knape, J., Singer, A., Snäll, T., Can opportunistically collected Citizen Science data fill a data gap for habitat suitability models of less common species?

Four barriers currently hold back its wide adoption: (1) user inexperience inhibits initial uptake; (2) complex and costly manufacturing/distribution procedures impede global dissemination; (3) lack of creator support results in lapsed projects; and (4) lack of user support degrades continued utility in the field.

Acoustic call counts recorded on an offshore hydrophone were highly variable from year to year. Assuming an average calling rate of 7.5 calls whale–1 d–1, the estimated number of whales migrating by this hydrophone would be &lt;10% of the population within 20 km of the offshore hydrophone in most years. In contrast, the estimated number of gray whales migrating off Santa Barbara and Los Angeles based on visual surveys grew at a greater rate (11% yr−1 and 26% yr−1, respectively) than the population size growth rate (5% yr−1). Over the studied migration seasons it seems an increasing proportion of the population was using the nearshore migration corridor in the Southern California Bight, especially near Los Angeles. This trend could increase the negative anthropogenic impact on this species. Although several large-scale climatic events occurred between 2008 and 2015, neither water temperature in the Southern California Bight nor sea ice timing in the gray whale Arctic feeding area improved generalized additive models of gray whale nearshore sightings or offshore acoustic presence. Over these times, the gray whale migration timing appears to be driven more by their biological clock and instinct than by the extrinsic factors accounted for in the present analysis. Future work should test if other factors influence the gray whale migration over longer timescales. © The authors 2019.","Acoustic monitoring; Generalized additive model; Gray whale; Migration; Sea ice; Southern California Bight; Temperature; Visual survey","annual variation; anthropogenic effect; bioacoustics; growth rate; migration; nearshore environment; population size; sea ice; survey method; temperature effect; water temperature; California; Los Angeles [California]; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Santa Barbara [California]; Southern California Bight; United States; Cetacea; Eschrichtiidae","Baldridge, A., Killer whales attack and eat a gray whale (1972) J Mammal, 53, pp. 898-900; Bay, S., Jones, B.H., Schiff, K., (1999) Study of the Impact of Stormwater Discharge on Santa Monica Bay, , Technical Report USCSG-TR-02-99, University of Southern California, Sea Grant Program, Los Angeles, CA; Boening, C., Willis, J.K., Landerer, F.W., Nerem, R.S., Fasullo, J., The 2011 La Niña: So strong, the oceans fell (2012) Geophys Res Lett, 39, p.

Although state-of-the-art soft robotic manipulators have demonstrated gentle gripping of brittle animals (e.g., corals) and echinoderms (e.g., sea cucumbers) in the deep sea, they are unable to nondestructively grasp more fragile soft-bodied organisms, such as jellyfish. Through an exploration of design parameters and laboratory testing of individual actuators, we confirmed that our nanofiber-reinforced soft actuators apply sufficiently low contact pressure to ensure minimal harm to typical jellyfish species. We then built a gripping device using several actuators and evaluated its underwater grasping performance in the laboratory. By assessing the gripper's region of acquisition and robustness to external forces, we gained insight into the necessary precision and speed with which grasping maneuvers must be performed to achieve successful collection of samples. Last, we demonstrated successful manipulation of three live jellyfish species in an aquarium setting using a hand-held prototype gripper. Overall, our ultragentle gripper demonstrates an improvement in gentle sample collection compared with existing deep-sea sampling devices. Extensions of this technology may improve a variety of in situ characterization techniques used to study the ecological and genetic features of deep-sea organisms. © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved.","","Actuators; Agricultural robots; Aquatic organisms; Grippers; Robotics; Design parameters; In-situ characterization techniques; Laboratory testing; Low contact pressure; Robotic actuators; Robotic grippers; Robotic manipulators; Sample collection; Manipulators","Grunenfelder, L.

Laser scanning produces models with high metric reliability and accuracy, whereas the main quality of the 3D photogrammetry is the result in term of photorealistic representation. Many studies have been conducted about the comparison and the integration of these different approaches and the aim of this paper is to contribute with a peculiar case study: the underground Roman bridge of San Lorenzo in Padova (Italy). The investigation regards the resulting point clouds of the intrados (or inner curve) of the central arch, comparing them and providing graphical and analytical outputs.

Results: Faecal pellets from five different rodent species were analysed by REIMS, and complex mass spectra were acquired rapidly (typically a few seconds per sample). The uninterpreted mass spectra (signatures) were then used to seed linear discriminant analysis and classification models based on random forests. It was possible to classify each species of origin with a high rate of accuracy, whether faeces were from animals maintained under standard laboratory conditions or wild-caught. REIMS signatures were stable to prior storage of the faecal material under a range of different conditions and were not altered rapidly or radically by changes in diet. Further, within species, REIMS signatures could be used to discriminate faeces from adult versus juvenile mice, male versus female mice and those from three different laboratory strains. Conclusions: REIMS offers a completely novel method for the rapid analysis of faecal samples, extending faecal analysis (previously focused on DNA) to an assessment of phenotype, and has considerable potential as a new tool in the armamentarium of the field biologist. © 2019 The Author(s).","Faecal analysis;

We start with 360° video streaming systems built for real experiments to investigate the practicality and efficiency of 360° video streaming. We then present the video and viewer datasets, which may be used to drive large-scale simulations and experiments. Different optimization tools in various stages of the 360° video streaming pipeline are discussed in detail. We also present various applications enabled by 360° video streaming. In the appendices, we review the off-the-shelf hardware available at the time of writing and the open research problems. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","360° videos; Video streaming; Virtual reality","Helmet mounted displays; Large dataset; Surveys; Virtual reality; Best effort; Head mounted displays; High resolution; Large scale simulations; Off-the-shelf hardwares; Optimization tools; Research problems; Short response time; Video streaming","Abbasi, A., Baroudi, U., Immersive environment: An emerging future of telecommunications (2012) IEEE Multimedia, 19 (1), p. 80. , Jan. 2012; Abdallah, M., Griwodz, C., Chen, K., Simon, G., Wang, P., Hsu, C., Delay-sensitive video computing in the cloud: A survey (2018) ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications, 14 (3), p. 54. , 2018; De Abreu, A., Ozcinar, C., Smolic, A., Look around you: Saliency maps for omnidirectional images in VR applications (2017) Proc.

Major benefits for environmental management, including improved accuracy and precision for population monitoring of fauna, are being realized. We used Australian fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus) as a model system to assess how counts and capture–mark–resight (CMR) estimates derived from RPA surveys compared with both traditionally used ground counts and CMR abundance estimates at two colonies in southeastern Australia. To manage the large volume of data, we implemented a citizen science portal SealSpotter to screen RPA imagery for animals of the target age classes. Capture–mark–resight estimates and direct counts using RPA imagery provided measurable improvement in monitoring precision when compared with traditional techniques. A key methodological assumption of CMR estimates is that there is uniform mixing of marked animals across the focal area. This was also validated using spatial data derived from images and linear models, a novel capability of the RPA technique. Our findings have the potential to improve wildlife monitoring techniques for fur seals and are broadly transferable to a wide range of other animal taxa where CMR techniques are employed. Furthermore, they add to the growing body of evidence that demonstrates the benefits of RPAs for wildlife monitoring exceed those of traditional techniques. © 2019 The Authors.","abundance; citizen science; drone; ecology; pinniped; population; wildlife","","Adame, K., Pardo, M.A., Salvadeo, C., Beier, E., Elorriaga-Verplancken, F.R., Detectability and categorization of California sea lions using an unmanned aerial vehicle (2017) Marine Mammal Science, 33, pp. 913-925; Alava, J.J., Ross, P.S., Pollutants in tropical marine mammals of the Galápagos Islands, Ecuador: an ecotoxicological quest to the last eden (2018) Marine mammal ecotoxicology, pp. 213-234. , Pages, M.

The systematic analysis, comparison, and synthesis of visitor monitoring methods, with the focus on methods for individual tracking, is conceptualized in the form of a mind map. The map serves as a basis for managed dialogues with experts from several protected areas in the Czech Republic. The theory and experts' practical insight are processed by the means of systems analysis with the aim to formulate (1) a guideline for the integration of heterogeneous data about visitors and (2) the concept of an advanced intelligent software tour guide with an individual tracking function. The proposed concept aims to achieve comprehensive monitoring of visitors' time-space behavior in the context of their socio-demographics, goals, preferences, feelings, and the resulting impressions. In addition, the visitor flows may be interactively influenced in a personalized way by the application, leading to better individual impressions and satisfaction, with full respect for the carrying capacity of the territory. Related challenges, such as the stimulation of visitors to use the application, are discussed. The ongoing experimental implementation of the concept as a part of a comprehensive destination application is mentioned at the end. © 2019 by the authors.","Carrying capacity; Intelligent software; Monitoring; Protected areas; Visitors management","carrying capacity; ecotourism; environmental management; integrated approach; protected area; software","Kuba, K., Monz, C., Bårdsen, B.-J., Hausner, V.H., Role of site management in influencing visitor use along trails in multiple alpine protected areas in Norway (2018) J.

In all likelihood though, single-factor explanation of population dynamics is inadequate, leaving gaps in our knowledge of the multitude of potential influences on small mammal abundance and occupancy patterns in time and space. Here, we investigated floristic gradients across four potential refuge sites of the central rock-rat, Zyzomys pedunculatus, a granivore rodent (50–120 g) that is endemic to central Australia and is categorised as critically endangered. The study took place in Tjoritja/West MacDonnell National Park in the MacDonnell Ranges bioregion. Floristic sampling was allocated across the four sites, the locations of which were predetermined by an established monitoring and management programme for the central rock-rat. Our aim was to examine the relationship between environmental gradients and floristic composition across the four sites, and thereby test the extent to which the patterns of food type and food availability can inform central rock-rat spatio-temporal dynamics. We found high site-scale floristic patterning that related foremost to elevation and then to antecedent rainfall and time-since-fire and fire-severity effects. To interpret these results, we applied the principles of refuge theory and we described a gradient from core refuge habitat to intermittent and then marginal habitat within the current central rock-rat stronghold area. Overall, our results implied a strong floristic basis to central rock-rat site occurrence, and they thus compel us to take explicit account of spatial (elevation) and temporal (rainfall–productivity and fire-disturbance) influences on the food axis of potential refuge sites of this critically endangered species. © 2019 Ecological Society of Australia and State of Northern Territory","boom-bust dynamics; central rock-rat; drought refuges; feral cat predation; granivore","colonization; community dynamics; conservation management; desert; drought; ecoregion; endangered species; environmental gradient; environmental monitoring; floristics; food availability; food supply; granivory; predation; predator-prey interaction; refuge; rodent; sampling; spatiotemporal analysis; Australia; MacDonnell Ranges; Northern Territory; Mammalia; Rattus; Rodentia; Zyzomys pedunculatus","Anderson, M.J., Gorley, R.N., Clarke, K.R., (2008) PERMANOVA+ for PRIMER, , &, PRIMER-E Ltd, Plymouth; (2018), http://www.bom.gov.au/climate.htm, [Cited 20 August 2018.] Available from; Cere, J., Vickery, W.L., Dickman, C.R., Refugia and dispersal promote population persistence under variable arid conditions: a spatio-temporal simulation model (2015) Ecosphere, 6, p. art225; Clarke, K.R., Gorley, R.N., (2015) PRIMER v7: User Manual/Tutorial, , &, Primer-E Ltd.

For the two sympatric Galliformes, Silver Pheasants (Lophura nycthemera) and White-necklaced Partridges (Arborophila gingica), we know little about the role of habitat use and interspecific interactions in modulating their coexistence. Methods: We adopted a probabilistic approach incorporating habitat preference and interspecific interaction using occupancy model to account for imperfect detection, and used daily activity pattern analysis to investigate the co-occurrence pattern of these two sympatric Galliformes in wet and dry seasons. Results: We found that the detection probability of Silver Pheasant and White-necklaced Partridge were related to habitat variables and interspecific interaction. The presence of Silver Pheasant increases the detection probability of White-necklaced Partridge in both the wet and dry season. However, the presence of White-necklaced Partridges increases the detection probability of Silver Pheasants in the wet season, but decreases the probability in the dry season. Further, Silver Pheasants were detected frequently in the sites of high values of enhanced vegetable index (EVI) in both the wet and dry season, and in sites away from human residential settlement in the wet season. White-necklaced partridges were mainly detected in low EVI sites. The site use probabilities of two Galliformes were best explained by habitat variables, Silver Pheasants and White-necklaced Partridges preferred steeper areas during the wet and dry season. Both species mainly occurred in low EVI areas during the wet season and occupied sites away from the resident settlement during the dry season. Moreover, the site use probabilities of two species had opposite relationships with forest canopy coverage. Silver Pheasants preferred areas with high forest canopy coverage whereas White-necklaced Partridges preferred low forest canopy coverage in the dry season, and vice versa in the wet season. Species interaction factor (SIF) corroborated weak evidence of the dependence of the site use of one species on that of the other in the either dry or wet season. Temporally, high overlapping of daily activity pattern indicated no significantly temporal niche differentiation between sympatric Galliformes in both wet and dry seasons. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that the presence of two species influenced the detection probability interactively and there was no temporal partitioning in activity time between Silver Pheasants and White-necklaced Partridges in the wet and dry seasons. The site use probability of two Galliformes was best explained by habitat variables, especially the forest canopy coverage. Therefore, environmental variables and interspecific interaction are the leading drivers regulating the detection and site use probability and promoting co-occurrence of Silver Pheasants and White-necklaced Partridges. © 2019 The Author(s).","Arborophila gingica; Co-occurrence; Habitat preference; Interspecific interaction; Lophura nycthemera; Occupancy model","","Ahumada, J.A., Hurtado, J., Lizcano, D., Monitoring the status and trends of tropical forest terrestrial vertebrate communities from camera trap data: A tool for conservation (2013) PLoS ONE, 8, p. e73707. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3sXhsVCrs7%2FL; Bailey, L.L., MacKenzie, D.I., Nichols, J.D., Cooch, E., Advances and applications of occupancy models (2014) Methods Ecol Evol, 5, pp. 1269-1279; Bastianelli, G., Wintle, B.A., Martin, E.H., Seoane, J., Laiolo, P., Species partitioning in a temperate mountain chain: Segregation by habitat vs. interspecific competition (2017) Ecol Evol, 7, pp. 2685-2696; Bu, H., Wang, F., McShea, W.J., Lu, Z., Wang, D., Li, S., Spatial co-occurrence and activity patterns of mesocarnivores in the temperate forests of Southwest China (2016) PLoS ONE, 11, p. e0164271; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., Multimodel inference: Understanding AIC and BIC in model selection (2004) Sociol Method Res, 33, pp. 261-304; Burton, C.A., Neilson, E., Moreira, D., Ladle, A., Steenweg, R., Fisher, J.T., Wildlife camera trapping: A review and recommendations for linking surveys to ecological processes (2015) J Appl Ecol, 52, pp. 675-685; Cai, D.S., Song, X.J., Bioresource and protection countermeasure in National Reserve of Chebaling in Guangdong province (2005) Ecol Sci, 24, pp. 282-285. , in Chinese; Chen, Y.H., Luiselli, L., Species richness and co-occurrence patterns of Galliformes in China at three large spatial scales: Does scale size matter?

Yet the resources for conservation are often limited and shared amongst many competing priorities [2]. As a consequence, even basic monitoring surveys are absent within most protected areas [3]. Although a range of wildlife monitoring methods exist, considerable focused survey effort is often required to yield accurate and precise estimates [4]. This makes monitoring difficult to sustain or replicate, limiting access to the data required for evidence-based conservation decisions. Citizen-scientists have been proposed as an important complement to the finite resources available for basic monitoring within protected areas [5]; however, the full potential of this approach has yet to be realised. Wildlife tourists and guides are especially focussed on encountering and photographing fauna and flora, yet the data collected in these efforts is rarely harnessed for conservation monitoring within protected areas. A detailed understanding of photographic tourism's potential role in wildlife monitoring has been lacking, but is essential for the development of new tools to harness the data being collected through tourism. Here, we demonstrate that tourist-contributed data can aid wildlife monitoring in protected areas by providing population estimates of large carnivores comparable to those from traditional survey methods. Our approach could capitalize upon the immense number of wildlife photographs being taken daily as part of the global > 30-billion USD, wildlife-based tourism industry. Population monitoring is an important component of wildlife conservation. Rafiq et al. demonstrate that tourist photographs can provide cost-effective, robust measures of wildlife densities that could be used toward species conservation efforts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","","animal; environmental protection; photography; procedures; travel; wild animal; Animals; Animals, Wild; Citizen Science; Conservation of Natural Resources; Photography; Travel","Leverington, F., Costa, K.L., Pavese, H., Lisle, A., Hockings, M., A global analysis of protected area management effectiveness (2010) Environ.

However, large areas outside priority sites have high conservation value and are referred to as neglected landscapes. The Eastern Ghats of India is an unexplored forest landscape of high conservation value with several endemic and threatened species reported, and is also home to many indigenous forest-dwelling communities. However, it remains a neglected area for conservation and only 3.53% of this landscape is protected. Here, we examine the effectiveness of protected areas in neglected landscapes in preventing forest degradation, and how community perceptions can be used to understand satellite-based landscape change analyses at village level. This study was conducted in Papikonda National park (PNP) and its unprotected buffers in India’s Eastern Ghats. Forest degradation was higher in the buffer (32%) than inside PNP (12%) between 1991 and 2014. Communities attributed shifting cultivation, plantations and over-extraction of forest resources as being the major drivers of forest degradation. Community observations of change were not significantly correlated with spatial measures of change. Forest degradation was higher outside the PA at a landscape level and inside the PA at the village level, therefore the PA was effective in reducing degradation at the landscape level but not at the village level inside the PA. We further discuss the role of community observations in interpreting forest degradation in neglected forest landscapes. © 2018, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.","Community observations; Eastern Ghats; Forest degradation; India; Protected areas","biodiversity; conservation status; endangered species; endemic species; forest cover; forest resource; landscape change; perception; protected area; shifting cultivation; Eastern Ghats; India; animal; biodiversity; endangered species; environmental protection; forest; India; Animals; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Endangered Species; Forests; India","Aditya, V., Ganesh, T., Camera trap records of Rusty-spotted Cat Prionailurus rubiginosus and Leopard Cat Prionailurus bengalensis (Mammalia: Carnivora: Felidae) from Papikonda National Park, northern Eastern Ghats, India (2016) Journal of Threatened Taxa, 8, pp. 8818-8819; Aditya, V., Ganesh, T., Mammals of Papikonda Hills, northern Eastern Ghats, India (2017) Journal of Threatened Taxa, 9, pp. 10823-10830; Agarwal, I., Datta-Roy, A., Bauer, A.M., Giri, V.B., Rediscovery of Geckoella jeyporensis (Squamata: Gekkonidae), with notes on morphology, coloration and habitat (2012) Hamadryad, 36, pp. 17-24; Barlow, J., Gardner, T.A., Araujo, I.S., Ávila-Pires, T.C., Bonaldo, A.B., Costa, J.E., Esposito, M.C., Hoogmoed, M.S., Quantifying the biodiversity value of tropical primary, secondary, and plantation forests (2007) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences United States of America, 104, pp. 18555-18560; Bawa, K.S., Seidler, R., Raven, P.H., Reconciling conservation paradigms (2004) Conservation Biology, 18, pp. 859-860; Brooks, T.M., Mittermeier, R.A., da Fonseca, G.A., Gerlach, J., Hoffmann, M., Lamoreux, J.F., Mittermeier, C.G., Rodrigues, A.S., Global biodiversity conservation priorities (2006) Science, 313, pp. 58-61; Cardillo, M., Mace, G.M., Gittleman, J.L., Purvis, A., Latent extinction risk and the future battlegrounds of mammal conservation (2006) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences United States of America, 103, pp. 4157-4161; (2017) Protected Area Coverage in the Hotspots, , http://www.cepf.net/resources/hotspots/Conservation-Responses/Pages/Protected-Area-Coverage-in-the-Hotspots.aspx, Retrieved May 31, 2017, from; Chazdon, R.L., Harvey, C.A., Komar, O., Griffith, D.M., Ferguson, B.G., Martínez-Ramos, M., Beyond reserves: A research agenda for conserving biodiversity in human-modified tropical landscapes (2009) Biotropica, 41, pp. 142-153; (2017) Why Hotspots Matter, , http://www.conservation.org/How/Pages/Hotspots.aspx, Retrieved June 26, 2017, from; Coppin, P., Jonckhere, I., Nackarts, K., Muys, B., Digital change detection methods in ecosystem monitoring: A review (2004) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 25, pp. 1565-1596; Daily, G.C., Ehrlich, P.R., Sanchez-Azofeifa, G.A., Countryside biogeography: Use of human-dominated habitats by the avifauna of southern Costa Rica (2001) Ecological Applications, 11, pp. 1-13; DeFries, R., Hansen, A., Newton, A.C., Hansen, M.C., Increasing isolation of protected areas in tropical forests over the past twenty years (2005) Ecological Applications, 15, pp. 19-26; DeFries, R., Karanth, K.K., Pareeth, S., Interactions between protected areas and their surroundings in human-dominated tropical landscapes (2010) Biological Conservation, 143, pp. 2870-2880; Fazey, I., Fischer, J., Lindenmayer, D.B., What do conservation biologists publish?

The growing phases is analyzed with remote sensing approaches. The remote sensing data employed is Landsat 8. The vegetation indices of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (ENDVI) are employed to analyze the growing phases and the harvest of sugarcane crops. Field survey was conducted in March and August 2017. The research results shows that March is the peak of the third phase (Stem elonging phase or grand growth phase), the period from May to July is the fourth phase (maturing or ripening phase), and the period from August to October is the peak of harvest. In January, the sugarcane crops begin to grow and some sugarcane crops enter the third phase again. The research results also found the sugarcane plants that do not grow well near the oil and gas field. This condition is estimated due as the impact of hydrocarbon microseepage. The benefit of this research is to identify the sugarcane growth cycle and harvest. Having knowing this, it will be easier to plan the seed development and crops transport. © 2019 Institut Pertanian Bogor.","ENDVI; Growth Phases; Landsat 8; NDVI; Sugarcane","","Apan, A., Detection of sugarcane ‘orange rust’ disease using EO-1 hyperion hyperspectral imagery (2004) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 25, pp. 489-498; Brantley, S.T., Application of hyperspectral vegetation indices to detect variations in high leaf area index temperate shrub thicket canopies (2011) Remote Sensing of Environment, 115, pp. 514-523; Bock, M., Object-orientedmethods for habitat mapping at multiple scales–Case studies from Northern Germany and Wye Downs, UK (2005) Journal for Nature Conservation, 13, pp. 75-89; Chimnarong, V., Opportunity for application of remote sensing and GIS approach for sugarcane production estimate in Thailand (2012) Proceedings of the 33rd Asian Conference on Remote Sensing.

We studied the ecology of a recent urban resident, the yellow mongoose, in an urban ecological estate in South Africa. We assessed urban dwelling yellow mongooses’ diet, spatial and temporal occurrence, home range size, and whenever possible, compared our findings to the published literature on their non-urban conspecifics. Additionally, we evaluated occurrence overlap with residential gardens. Similar to their non-urban counterparts, scat analyses revealed that yellow mongooses in urban areas fed mainly on insects, particularly during spring/summer. In the colder months, anthropogenic items, small mammals and birds in scats increased. Camera trap surveys showed that the mongooses were common in open habitats, similar to previous studies, and exhibited a species-typical bimodal diurnal activity pattern. The occurrence of these mongooses was greater near human residences than at sites further away. Home range sizes were considerably smaller than those of non-urban mongoose. Mongoose occurred in residential gardens, more so during the colder months. The urban yellow mongooses’ diet, habitat preference and activity patterns were similar to non-urban conspecifics. Nonetheless, the exploitation of anthropogenic food sources, occurrence in residential gardens and smaller home range sizes showed that they respond flexibly to urbanization, and these modifications might aid in their success in urban areas. © 2019 by the authors.

The premise is utilizing natural history collections/data, such as specimens and biodiversity observations, with information and communication technology. During the past two decades, biodiversity informatics has improved dramatically and has been applied increasingly in ecology science. In this paper, I review biodiversity informatics for ecology with a particular focus on the treatment of data. First, I discuss the traditional perspective of data collection and its usage in the ecological community. Then, I provide an overview of the trajectory of changing perspectives of data treatment relative to developing biodiversity informatics (i.e., the infiltration of the data reuse and sharing concepts). Specifically, I discuss the significance of data reuse, which offers numerous benefits for research, and data sharing with their supporting mechanisms and case studies.

Anthropogenic defaunation is one the most important contemporary threats to modern mammal faunas. Although the Atlantic Forest biome of South America shows several clear signs of defaunation, the extent to which this biome has lost its mammal fauna remains poorly understood. Here, we collate and analyze a comprehensive body of secondary data to quantitatively assess the spatial patterns of defaunation of all medium- to large-bodied Atlantic Forest mammals which were then classed by morpho-ecological traits. We used a Defaunation Index, which was scaled-up to the entire biome using kriging interpolation, to examine the integrity of site-specific mammal faunas. We further use environmental and socioeconomic predictors to explain the drivers of defaunation. Our results show high levels of defaunation (>0.5) for most of the Atlantic Forest. Apex predators, other carnivores, large-bodied mammals and large herbivores were among the most defaunated functional groups. Remaining native vegetation cover, forest fragment size, and the largest neighboring forest remnant were the main negative predictors of defaunation. We conclude that medium- to large-bodied Atlantic Forest mammals are under high levels of threat due to historical population losses that continue today. A conservation action plan thus becomes imperative to prevent this biome from becoming an even ""emptier forest"", severely compromising patterns of diversity, ecological processes and ecosystem functioning. © 2018 Bogoni et al.

We undertook three years of ethnographic fieldwork and design research with the recovery team of an endangered Australian bird (the Eastern bristlebird) to explore the team's culture and practices, as well as their perspectives on including collection and analysis of environmental acoustic recordings into their conservation praxis. Through thematic analysis, we identified the team's collective goals, culture, conservation activities, and technology use. We found that acoustic technologies have promise for supporting conservation of furtive and vocal Eastern bristlebirds. Trialing acoustic technologies also revealed that the team had strong interest in their use. We identified knowledge gaps, time constraints, and technology aversion as barriers to be overcome with future interaction design research.

These effects arise because prey often induce costly phenotypic responses to mitigate predation risk. Yet because predator-prey interactions are complex, prey defenses may vary considerably. We investigated if the Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), a reptile apex predator, induced multiscale antipredator responses in key prey, the Rusa deer (Cervus timorensis) and the wild pig (Sus scrofa). To this end, we examined the temporal and spatial partitioning of habitats by predator and prey, determined the size of ungulate groups as a function of risk, and assessed changes in individual behavior of prey individuals exposed to predator kairomones at feeding stations. Komodo dragon, deer, and pig populations exhibited significant, but subtle differences in 3 habitat preferences that otherwise indicated high niche overlap. Komodo dragon predation risk, alongside other commonly considered predictor variables, did not affect deer or pig group size. With the exception of one individual-based vigilance-type behavior in pigs, no other antipredator behavior, including reduced food consumption, significantly varied in the presence of predator odor cue at feeding stations. Overall, our results indicated limited evidence for antipredator behavior and suggested Komodo dragons exert weak nonconsumptive effects of predation in ungulates. However, weak predatory interactions could be beneficial in island ecosystems as it could promote predator-prey coexistence that reduces extinction risk. © The Author(s) 2019.

Pale yellowbrown individuals are more frequent in coastal populations while there is a tendency of increasing the frequency of red-dark morphs in inland areas. Considering the variation in substrate color along the species distribution (light/sandy on the coast to reddish and dark/argillaceous in inland areas), we raise the hypothesis that the predation rate of each morph would be lower in sites were its crypsis potential is higher. If correct, this hypothesis would reinforce the idea that the predation risk is one of the factors influencing the spatial structuring in morph frequency distributions in populations of P. lemniscatus. To test this hypothesis, we performed a field experiment using plasticine P. lemniscatus artificial models that represent two morphs: red-dark and pale yellow-brown. The models were distributed in three localities where the following substrate types predominate: light (Coastal Site), intermediary (Lowland Site) and reddish dark (Highland Site). Our predictions were corroborated only at the coastal site, where the less cryptic morph was the most preyed one. We verified that there is a regional variation in the predation risk on different morphs. Thus, the possibility that the selective pressure by predators is a relevant element in the structuring of the frequencies of different morph populations of this species cannot be completely excluded. © Acta Herpetologica 2019.

Population size is influenced by different biotic and abiotic factors thatsatisfy the requirements of the species to survive and reproduce, allowing the permanence of the species through time.Because population size is not homogeneous throughout the distribution, there are several hypotheses to explain theirvariations. One proposal considers that more abundant populations are located in regions with environmentally suitability, and population size decreases towards the less favorable ones. Another hypothesis considers that the population size is related to the internal structure of the ecological niche, where the largest populations are located in the centroid of the niche, and the size decliness the distance to this centroid increase. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between population abundance, environmental suitability and ecological niche in four wild felids species of America. The density of Lynx rufus (bobcat) was correlated positively with the environmental suitability index, the highest density of Panthera onca (jaguar) was located in regions near the centroid of the niche, while the population densities of Leopardus pardalis (ocelot) and Puma concolor (cougar) did not conform to the predictions ofeither of the two hypotheses. The relationship between feline density and environmental characteristics was speciesspecific, with no general pattern. © 2019 by Revista de Biologia Tropical.

Here, we conduct the first broad comparative study of phenotypic variation along elevational gradients, integrating a large array of ecological predictors and disentangling population genetic driver processes. The skull form of nine ecologically distinct species distributed over a large altitudinal range (100–4200 m) was compared to assess whether phenotypic divergence is a common phenomenon in small mammals and whether it shows parallel patterns. We also investigated the relative contribution of biotic (competition and predation) and abiotic parameters on phenotypic divergence via mixed models. Finally, we assessed the population genetic structure of a rodent species (Niviventer confucianus) via analysis of molecular variance and FST along three mountain slopes and tested the isolation-by-environment hypothesis using Mantel test and redundancy analysis. We found a consistent phenotypic divergence and marked genetic structure along elevational gradients; however, the species showed mixed patterns of size and skull shape trends across mountain zones. Individuals living at lower altitudes differed greatly in both phenotype and genotype from those living at high elevations, while middle-elevation individuals showed more intermediate forms. The ecological parameters associated with phenotypic divergence along elevation gradients are partly related to species' ecological and evolutionary constraints. Fossorial and solitary animals are mainly affected by climatic factors, while terrestrial and more gregarious species are influenced by biotic and abiotic parameters. A novel finding of our study is that predator richness emerged as an important factor associated with the intraspecific diversification of the mammalian skull along elevational gradients, a previously overlooked parameter. Population genetic structure was mainly driven by environmental heterogeneity along mountain slopes, with no or a week spatial effect, fitting the isolation-by-environment scenario. Our study highlights the strong and multifaceted effects of heterogeneous steep habitats and ecologically based divergent selective forces in small mammal populations. © 2019 The Authors.

Southwest China is home to not only global biodiversity hotspots, but also rapid economic and population growth and extensive changes in land use. However, because of the large regional span, the diverse species distributions, and the difficulty of field investigations, traditional methods used to assess umbrella species are not suitable for implementation in Southwest China. In the current study, we assessed 810 key protected species from seven taxa by indicator value analysis, correlation analysis, and factor analysis. We selected 32 species as umbrella species, whose habitats overlapped the habitats of 97% of the total species. Furthermore, the selected species were significantly correlated with 70% of all species in the study area. A total of 16 out of 19 selected animal species have been previously mentioned as umbrella species, compared with only 3 out of 13 plants species; this is despite plants accounting for a large proportion of the total species in Southwest China. We discuss the roles of indicator species and co-occurring species, and provide suggestions for species protection in Southwest China based on the current results. Our research provides valuable scientific information for research on umbrella conservation species over large geographical scales, and related fields of biodiversity conservation. © 2019 by the authors.

Trails constitute the main recreation facility in protected areas. They are an important and common infrastructure that concentrates visitor movement. Their sustainable planning and management requires an understanding of how the visitors made their selection. The aim of this study was to identify the effect of trail attributes on visitor numbers in the Krkonoše Mountains National Park in the Czech Republic. The methods used in this study present an analytical approach involving geographic information system analysis, field monitoring and data analyses using generalised linear models. The results showed the preferential tendencies among visitors to certain trail attributes. Marginal significance and a rather strong variability in preferences (over 10%) were identified for five trail characteristics: the amount of local attractions; diversity of land cover types; dominant land cover along a trail; soil erosion; and the type of trail surface. In our study, we illustrate an analytical framework for the assessment of trail characteristics that can help guide trail analyses and management efforts. On the other hand, our findings raise new research questions and point to the requirements for further research in order to better understand how environmental attributes influence visitor choice and to use this knowledge for trail planning and management. © 2019 Kamila Svobodova et al., published by Sciendo 2019.","Krkonoše mountains national park; Nature conservation; Route attributes; Tourism; Trail research","","Arnberger, A., Eder, R., The influence of age on recreational trail preferences of urban green-space visitors: A discrete choice experiment with digitally calibrated images (2011) Journal of Environmental Planning and Management, 54, pp. 891-908; Ballantyne, M., Pickering, C.M., The impacts of trail infrastructure on vegetation and soils: Current literature and future directions (2015) Journal of Environmental Management, 164, pp. 53-64; Balmford, A., Green, J.M.H., Anderson, M., Beresford, J., Huang, C., Naidoo, R., Walpole, M., Manica, A., Walk on the wild side: Estimating the global magnitude of visits to protected areas (2015) PLoS Biology, 13 (2), pp. 1-6; Barroso, F.L., Pinto-Correia, T., Ramos, I.L., Surová, D., Menezes, H., Dealing with fuzziness in user preference studies: Photo based questionnaires in the Mediterranean context (2012) Landscape and Urban Planning, 104, pp. 329-342; Becken, S., Simmons, D.G., Understanding energy consumption patterns of tourist attractions and activities in New Zealand (2002) Tourism Management, 23 (4), pp. 343-354; Kohlová, B.M., Melichar, J., Kaprová, K., (2017) Methodology for Monitoring of Visitors to Protected Areas, , Prague, Nature Protection Agency of the Czech Republic; Buckley, R., Neat trends: Current issues in nature, eco-And adventure tourism (2000) International Journal of Tourism Research, 2, pp. 437-444; Buckley, R., (2009) Ecotourism: Principles and Practices, , CABI, Oxford; Bulut, Z., Yilmaz, H., Determination of landscape beauties through visual quality assessment method: A case study for Kemaliye (Erzincan/Turkey) (2008) Environmental Monitoring and Assessment, 141, pp. 121-129; Cañas, I., Ayuga, E., Ayuga, F., A contribution to the assessment of scenic qualiTY of LANDSCAPES BASED on PREFERENCES EXPRESSED by the PUBLIC (2009) Land Use Policy, 26, pp. 1173-1181; Cessford, G., Cockburn, S., Douglas, M., Developing new visitor counters and their applications for management (2002) First Monitoring and Management of Visitor Flows in Recreational and Protected Areas Conference Vienna, , http://mmv.boku.ac.at/downloads/mmv1-proceedings.pdf; Cihar, M., Stursa, J., Trebicky, V., (2002) Monitoring of Tourism in the Czech National Parks.[in:] A.Arnberger; Brandenburg, C., Muhar, A., Monitoring and Management of Visitor Flows in Recreational and Protected Areas Conference Proceedings.Institute for Landscape Architecture and Landscape Management, pp. 240-245. , BOKU-University of Natural Resources and Applied Sciences, Vienna; Crawley, M.J., (2007) The R Book.John Wiley and Sons, , Chichester; Dallimer, M., Katherine, N.I., Andrew, M.J.S., Zoe, G.D., Paul, R.A., James, R.R., Lorraine, L.M., Kevin, J.G., Biodiversity and the feel-good factor: Understanding associations between self-reported human well-being and species richness (2012) BioScience, 62 (1), pp. 47-55; Dantonio, A., Monz, C., Newman, P., Lawson, S., Taff, D., Enhancing the utility of visitor impact assessment in parks and protected areas: A combined social-ecological approach (2013) Journal of Environmental Management, 124, pp. 72-81; Drahný, R., (2018) We Exactly Know It Now-Czech Part of the Krkonoše Mountains Are Visited by 11 Million Visitors per Year, , https://www.krnap.cz/aktuality/tz-Ted-uz-To-vime-presne-ceske-krkonose-maji-pres-11-milionu-navstev-rocne(07.12.2018); Drábková, A., Šišák, L., Forest visitors?

Quantifying these impacts has become central to understanding the dynamics of coupled human-natural systems, resource-dependent livelihoods, and biodiversity conservation. Ecologists are facing growing pressure to quantify the size, distribution, and trajectory of wild populations in a cost-effective and socially acceptable manner. Genetic tagging, combined with modern computational and genetic analyses, is an under-utilized tool to meet this demand, especially for wide-ranging, elusive, sensitive, and low-density species. Genetic tagging studies are now revealing unprecedented insight into the mechanisms that control the density, trajectory, connectivity, and patterns of human–wildlife interaction for populations over vast spatial extents. Here, we outline the application of, and ecological inferences from, new analytical techniques applied to genetically tagged individuals, contrast this approach with conventional methods, and describe how genetic tagging can be better applied to address outstanding questions in ecology. We provide example analyses using a long-term genetic tagging dataset of grizzly bears in the Canadian Rockies. The genetic tagging toolbox is a powerful and overlooked ensemble that ecologists and conservation biologists can leverage to generate evidence and meet the challenges of the Anthropocene. © 2019 The Authors.

This observation has important implications for the emergence of confrontational scavenging, which may have played a significant role in human evolution. Many scholars agree that eating meat became important during human evolution, and hominins first obtained meat by scavenging. However, it is debatable whether scavenging behavior was “passive” or “confrontational (power).” The latter is more dangerous, as it requires facing the original predator, and it is thus considered to have been important for the evolution of several human traits, including cooperation and language. Chimpanzees do scavenge meat, although rarely, but no previous evidence of confrontational scavenging has hitherto emerged. Thus, it was assumed that they are averse to confrontation with even leopard-sized predators. However, in the observed case the chimpanzees frequently emitted waa barks, which indicated that they were aware of the leopard's presence but they nevertheless continued to eat the scavenged meat. In addition, we compiled and reviewed 49 cases of chimpanzee encounters with animal carcasses in the Mahale Mountains of Tanzania in 1980–2017. Chimpanzees scavenged meat in 36.7% of these cases, and tended to eat the meat when it was fresh or if the animal species was usually hunted by chimpanzees. However, no evidence indicated that carcasses were avoided when leopard involvement was likely. These results suggest that chimpanzee-sized hominins could potentially confront and deprive leopard-size carnivores of meat. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Animal carcass; Chimpanzee; Confrontational scavenging; Leopard; Mahale Mountains; Meat-eating","carnivore; carrion; felid; hominid; predation; scavenging (feeding); wild population; Kigoma [Tanzania]; Mahale Mountains National Park; Tanzania; Animalia; Pan; Pan troglodytes; Panthera pardus; article; carcass; carnivore; case report; chimpanzee; clinical article; eating; human; human experiment; language; leopard; nonhuman; predator; Tanzania","Ardrey, R., African Genesis: A Personal Investigation into the Animal Origins and Nature of Man (1961), Dell Publishing New York; Baldus, R.D., A man-eating lion (Panthera leo) from Tanzania with a toothache (2006) European Journal of Wildlife Research, 52, pp. 59-62; Benjamini, Y., Hochberg, Y., Controlling the false discovery rate: a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing (1995) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B, 57, pp. 289-300; Bickerton, D., Adam's Tongue: How Humans Made Language, How Language Made Humans (2009), Hill and Wang New York; Bickerton, D., Szathmáry, E., Confrontational scavenging as a possible source for language and cooperation (2011) BMC Evolutionary Biology, 11, p. 261; Blumenschine, R.J., Characteristics of an early hominid scavenging niche (1987) Current Anthropology, 28, pp. 383-407; Blumenschine, R.J., Percussion marks, tooth marks, and experimental determinations of the timing of hominid and carnivore access to long bones at FLK Zinjanthropus, Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania (1995) Journal of Human Evolution, 29, pp. 21-51; Blumenschine, R.J., Prassack, K.A., Kreger, C.D., Pante, M.C., Carnivore tooth-marks, microbial bioerosion, and the invalidation of Domínguez-Rodrigo and Barba's (2006) test of Oldowan hominin scavenging behavior (2007) Journal of Human Evolution, 53, pp. 420-426; Boesch, C., The effects of leopard predation on grouping patterns in forest chimpanzees (1991) Behaviour, 117, pp. 220-242; Boesch, C., The Real Chimpanzee: Sex Strategies in the Forest (2009), Cambridge University Press Cambridge; Boesch, C., Boesch-Achermann, H., The Chimpanzees of the Taï Forest: Behavioral Ecology and Evolution (2000), Oxford University Press Oxford; Brand, C., Eguma, R., Zuberbühler, K., Hobaiter, C., First report of prey capture from human laid snare-traps by wild chimpanzees (2014) Primates, 55, pp. 437-440; Bunn, H.T., Hunting, power scavenging, and butchering by Hadza foragers and by Plio-Pleistocene Homo (2001) Meat-Eating and Human Evolution, pp. 199-218. , C.B.

Americo Vespucio 26, Seville, Spain","Human-carnivore conflicts arise as one of the most urgent carnivore conservation issues worldwide. Jaguars (Panthera onca) and pumas (Puma concolor) coexist with livestock in much of their range and have been historically blamed for livestock predation. At present, livestock landscapes are increasing, enlarging the conflict scenario where local perceptions are vital to understand the context in which the conflict emerges and data of livestock predation become an effective tool to plunge into it. We assess local perceptions about felids and identify the bases of the conflict in the Bolivian Pantanal and dry forest ecoregions using livestock predation data. We interviewed local ranchers and crossed information with the governmental livestock database achieving a comprehensive study on the conflict, based on descriptive statistics for local perceptions and generalized linear mixed models for analyzing cattle predation by felids. The conflict appeared to be widespread since most ranchers suffered predation on cattle, especially in the Pantanal. Annual cattle loss is generally low (1.8%) with some exceptions that may magnify the generalized negative perception towards felids. Factors related to cattle management practices explained better felid predation on livestock rather than habitat quality of the ranch or ranchers’ attitude towards felids. We recommend local administrations to recover livestock predation data and to highlight the importance that husbandry practices may have to reduce cattle losses by felids. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Apex felids; Extensive ranching; Livestock predation; Model averaging","","Anderson, D.R., (2008) Model based inference in the life sciences: a primer on evidence, , Springer, New York; Arispe, R., (2008) Looking for Opportunities to Protect the Jaguar (Panthera Onca) in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, , Jaguar News; Arispe, R., Rumiz, D., Venegas, C., Noss, A., (2006) El Conflicto De La depredación De Ganado Por Jaguar (Panthera Onca) En Santa Cruz, Bolivia in Conference, , Conflito Homem-Animal Ilheus; Athreya, V., Odden, M., Linnell, J.D.C., Krishnaswamy, J., Karanth, U., Big cats in our backyards: persistence of large carnivores in a human dominated landscape in India (2013) PLoS One, 8, pp. 2-9; Azevedo, F., Murray, D.L., Evaluation of potential factors predisposing livestock to predation by jaguars (2007) J Wildl Manag, 71, p. 2379; Bagchi, S., Mishra, C., Living with large carnivores: predation on livestock by the snow leopard (Uncia uncia) (2006) J Zool, 268, pp. 217-224; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (2002) Model selection and multimodel inference: a practical information-theoretic approach, , 2, Springer-Verlag, New York; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., Model selection and multimodel inference (2004) Ecol Model, 172, pp. 96-97; Cavalcanti, S.M.C., Gese, E.M., Kill rates and predation patterns of jaguars (Panthera onca) in the southern Pantanal, Brazil (2010) J Mammal, 91, pp. 722-736; Cavalcanti, S.M.C., Marchini, S., Zimmermann, A., Gese, E.M., Macdonald, D.W., Jaguars, livestock, and people in Brazil: Realities and perceptions behind the conflict (2010) Biol Conserv Wild Felids, pp. 383-402; Chapron, G., Kaczensky, P., Linnell, J.D.C., von Arx, M., Huber, D., Andrén, H., López-Bao, J.V., Boitani, L., Recovery of large carnivores in Europe’s modern human-dominated landscapes (2014) Science (80-), 346, pp. 1514-1517; Chavez, A.S., Gese, E.M., Landscape use and movements of wolves in relation to livestock in a wildland-agriculture matrix (2006) J Wildl Manag, 70, pp. 1079-1086; Chavez, A., Gese, E.M., Krannich, R.S., Attitudes of rural landowners toward wolves in northwestern Minnesota (2005) Wildl Soc Bull, 33, pp. 517-527; Conforti, V., Azevedo, F., (2003) Local perceptions of jaguars (Panthera onca) and pumas (Puma concolor) in the Iguaçu National Park area, south Brazil, 111, pp. 215-221. , Bio Cons; Conover, M., (2002) Resolving Human-Wildlife Conflicts: The Science of Wildlife Damage Management, , Lewis Publishers; Crawshaw, P., Depredation of domestic animals by large cats in Brazil (2004) Hum Dimens Wildl, 9, pp. 329-330; (2011) Catastro Ganadero 2011, , Secretaría de Desarrollo Productivo, Gobierno Departamental Santa Cruz de la Sierra; Estes, J., Terborgh, J., Brashares, J.S., Power, M.E., Berger, J., Bond, W.J., Carpenter, S.R., Wardle, D., Trophic downgrading of planet earth (2011) Science, 333, pp. 301-306. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3MXos1ylur0%3D; Foster, R., Harmsen, B., Valdez, B., Pomilla, C., Doncaster, C., Food habits of sympatric jaguars and pumas, across a gradient of human disturbance (2010) J Zool, 280, pp. 309-318; Foster, R.J., Harmsen, B.J., Macdonald, D.W., Collins, J., Urbina, Y., Garcia, R., Doncaster, C.P., Wild meat: A shared resource amongst people and predators (2014) Oryx, pp. 1-13; Gilroy, J.J., Ordiz, A., Bischof, R., Carnivore coexistence: value the wilderness (2015) Sci Lett, 347, p. 382. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2MXmtlagt7s%3D; Graham, K., Beckerman, A.P., Thirgood, S., Human–predator–prey conflicts: ecological correlates, prey losses and patterns of management (2004) Biol Conserv, 122, pp. 159-171; Hoogesteijn, A., (1993) Jaguar predation and consrvation: cattle mortality caused by felines on three ranches in the Venezuelan Llanos, , Zool.

The outcomes for vegetation depend on changes to specific plant–animal interactions, such as seed dispersal or predation, or physical disturbances. We experimentally manipulated terrestrial wildlife populations in a primary lowland forest in Malaysia over an 18-year period (1996–2014) to understand how artificially high or low animal densities affect tree and liana regeneration. Our study site retains a diverse wildlife community and artificially high densities of native wild pigs (Sus scrofa) that are sustained by crop raiding in distant oil palm plantations. We used fencing that excluded terrestrial animals >1 kg to experimentally simulate conditions similar to those in defaunated forests. These two treatments – abnormally high pig abundances and megafauna loss from hunting – represent common outcomes in disturbed Southeast Asian forests and are characteristic of many forests globally. We focused on trees and lianas because they are the two dominant woody life-forms in tropical forests and crucial determinants of forest structure and function. We found that liana sapling abundances (30–100 cm height) increased by 86% in unfenced control plots with wildlife but were stable in exclosures. In contrast, tree abundances did not change in unfenced control plots but increased by 83% in exclosures without wildlife. Evidence of scaring on surviving stems suggested that these inverted outcomes were driven by selective use of tree saplings for wild pig nests. Lianas may also have greater tolerance to wildlife disturbances like nest building. By the end of the study, lianas comprised 38% of all saplings in unfenced controls but just 14% in exclosures. Synthesis and applications. We conclude that artificially abundant wildlife, such as crop-raiding wild pigs, may shift tropical forest understories towards lianas while defaunation may shift it towards trees. These results highlight that ecological cascades from hunting or land use change can alter plant functional types and reshape to long-term patterns of forest succession and change. Managing unnatural wild boar populations may be required to conserve native plant communities in both their native and exotic ranges. © 2019 The Authors.

Highly-mobile species often violate the assumption that sampling units are geographically closed shifting the probability of occupancy to be interpreted as the probability of use. We used occupancy models, in conjunction with noninvasive sampling, to estimate habitat use and predict the distribution of a highly-mobile carnivore, the American black bear (Ursus americanus) in New Mexico, USA. The top model indicated that black bears use areas with higher primary productivity and fewer roads. The predictive performance of such models is rarely validated with independent data, so we validated our model predictions with 2-independent datasets. We first assessed the correlation between predicted and observed habitat use for 28 telemetry-collared bears in the Jemez Mountains. Predicted habitat use was positively correlated with observed use for all 3 years (2012: ρ = 0.81; 2013: ρ = 0.87; 2014: ρ = 0.90). We then predicted the probability of use within a cell where a bear mortality was documented using 2043 mortality locations from sport harvest, depredation, and vehicle collisions. The probability of habitat use at a mortality location was also positively correlated with observed use by the species (2012: ρ = 0.74; 2013: ρ = 0.89; 2014: ρ = 0.93). Our validation procedure supports the notion that occupancy models can be an effective tool for estimating habitat use and predicting the distribution of highly-mobile species when the assumption of geographic closure has been violated. Our findings may be of interest to studies that are estimating habitat use for highly-mobile species that are secretive or rare, difficult to capture, or expensive to monitor with other more intensive methods. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Habitat use; Model validation; Occupancy modeling; Species distribution; Ursus americanus","bear; biotelemetry; ecological modeling; estimation method; habitat use; model validation; mortality; nature-society relations; road; spatial distribution; wild population; Jemez Mountains; New Mexico; United States; Ursus americanus","Araújo, M.B., Anderson, R.P., Barbosa, A.M., Beale, C.M., Dormann, C.F., Early, R., Garcia, R.A., Rahbek, C., Standards for distribution models in biodiversity assessments (2019) Science Advances, 5; Arnold, T.W., Uninformative parameters and model selection using Akaike's Information Criterion (2010) Journal of Wildlife Management, 74, pp. 1175-1178; Babu, S., Karthik, T., Srinivas, G., Kumara, H.N., Linking critical patches of sloth bear Melursus ursinus for their conservation in Meghamalai hills, Western Ghats (2015) India.

Américo Vespucio s/n, CP 41092, Seville, Spain","The method presented in here allows for the unequivocal differentiation between non-invasive samples of ocelots and margays, when used in combination with the protocol by Roques et al. (Mol Ecol Resour 11:171–175, 2011). It reduced costs and laboratory processing, decreasing the chances of contamination, and therefore facilitating the identification of large numbers of samples by simple PCR amplification, without the need for sequencing. Our protocol was tested on 371 faeces collected in the field in 25 different sites across the distribution areas of both species, and compared to the mtDNA sequencing of 23 of the samples. The concatenation of a commonly used segment of Cytochrome b with other mitochondrial markers such as ATP-8 allows the identification of these two sister-species, but there was not enough resolution when used alone. With this new method, we could identify 98% of the field faeces, obtaining a global rate of 22.3 faeces of ocelot per margay sample in roads and trails located in potential areas of coexistence, suggesting generally lower densities of margay, although margays could be underestimated due to their arboreal habits. In Serra das Almas, located in the Brazilian Caatinga, the number of faeces of ocelot detected was especially elevated. Low densities of ocelots could be favoring higher densities of margays in areas like the Sinaloan dry forests and the Chimalapas montane forests, both in Mexico. Ocelots were found from open to forested habitats, including mosaic cropland and grassland, however margays were only found in forests where average canopy height exceeded 5 m. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Faeces; Leopardus pardalis; Leopardus wiedii; Species identification; Species-specific primers","","Bartlett, S.E., Davidson, W.S., FINS (forensically informative nucleotide sequencing): a procedure for identifying the animal origin of biological specimens (1992) Biotechniques, 12, pp. 408-411; Bhavanishankar, M., Reddy, P.A., Gour, D.S., Shivaji, S., Validation of non-invasive genetic identification of two elusive, sympatric, sister-species—tiger (Panthera tigris) and leopard (Panthera pardus) (2013) Curr Sci, 104, pp. 1063-1067; Bianchi, R.C., Rosa, A.F., Gatti, A., Mendes, S.L., Diet of margay, Leopardus wiedii, and jaguarundi, Puma yagouaroundi, (Carnivora: Felidae) in Atlantic Rainforest, Brazil (2011) Zoologia, 28, pp. 127-132; Bontemps, S., Defourny, P., van Bogaert, E., Arino, O., Kalogirou, V., Ramos Perez, J.J., (2011) GLOBCOVER 2009, , UCLouvain & ESA Team; Boom, R., Sol, C.J.A., Salimans, M.M.M., Jansen, C.L., Wertheim-van Dillen, P.M.E., Van der Noordaa, J., Rapid and simple method for purification of nucleic acids (1990) J Clin Microbiol, 28, pp. 495-503; Calleia, F.O., Rohe, F., Gordo, M., Hunting strategy of the Margay (Leopardus wiedii) to attract the wild pied tamarin (Saguinus bicolor) (2009) Neotrop Primates, 16, pp. 32-34; Carvajal-Villarreal, S., Caso, A., Downey, P., Moreno, A., Tewes, M.E., Grassman, L.I., Spatial patterns of the margay (Leopardus wiedii; Felidae, Carnivora) at “El Cielo” biosphere reserve, Tamaulipas, Mexico (2012) Mammalia, 76, pp. 237-244; Chaves, P.B., Graeff, V.G., Lion, M.B., Oliveira, L.R., Eizirik, E., DNA barcoding meets molecular scatology: short mtDNA sequences for standardized species assignment of carnivore noninvasive samples (2012) Mol Ecol Resour, 12, pp. 18-35; Cossíos, D., Angers, B., Identification of Andean felid species using PCR-RFLP (2006) Mastozool Neotrop, 13, pp. 239-244; Cuellar, E., Maffei, L., Arispe, R., Noss, A., Geoffroy’s cats at the northern limit of their range: activity patterns and density estimates from camera trapping in Bolivian dry forests (2006) Stud Neotrop Fauna Environ, 41, pp. 169-177; Dalén, L., Götherström, A., Angerbjörn, A., Identifying species from pieces of faeces (2004) Conserv Genet, 5, pp. 109-111; Davison, A., Birks, J.D.S., Brookes, R.C., Braithwaite, T.C., Messenger, J.E., On the origin of faeces: morphological versus molecular methods for surveying rare carnivores from their scats (2002) J Zool, 257, pp. 141-143; de Oliveira, T., Paviolo, A., Schipper, J., Bianchi, R., Payan, E., Carvajal, S., (2015), Leopardus wiedii.

Until recently, only a limited number of measurement standards have been permitted by most regulators, with emphasis on close-range methods (e.g. Method-21, optical gas imaging). Although close-range methods are essential for source identification, they can be labor-intensive. To improve LDAR efficiency, there has been a policy shift in Canada and the United States towards incorporating alternative technologies. However, the suitability of these technologies for LDAR remains unclear. In this paper, we systematically review and compare six technology classes for use in LDAR: handheld instruments, fixed sensors, mobile ground labs (MGLs), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), aircraft, and satellites. These technologies encompass broad spatial and temporal scales of measurement. Minimum detection limits for technology classes range from &lt;1 g h-1 for Method 21 instruments to 7.1 × 106 g h-1 for the GOSAT satellite, and uncertainties are poorly constrained. To leverage the diverse capabilities of these technologies, we introduce a hybrid screening-confirmation approach to LDAR called a comprehensive monitoring program. Here, a screening technology is used to rapidly tag high-emitting sites to direct close-range source identification. Currently, fixed sensors, MGLs, UAVs, and aircraft could be used as screening technologies, but their performances must be evaluated under a range of environmental and operational conditions to better constrain detection effectiveness. Methane-sensing satellites are improving rapidly and may soon be ready for facility-scale screening. We conclude with a speculative discussion of the future of LDAR, touching on integration, analytics, incentivization, and regulatory pathways. © 2019 The Author(s).

A defining characteristic of the Anthropocene is habitat conversion (land-use change) for agricultural and urbanized land uses. Within this context, landscape ecology is of critical importance as it examines the influence of spatial heterogeneity on ecological patterns and processes at spatial and temporal extents that are larger than those traditionally studied in ecology. The application of landscape ecological approaches to mammalian populations, communities, and metacommunities began in and has increased steadily since the 1990s. Non-volant small mammals or bats are often the focus of landscape studies of communities, whereas carnivores or artiodactyls are commonly the focus of population-level studies cast within the domains of conservation or wildlife management. Research on the landscape ecology of mammals has primarily been conducted in Europe and North America, but with increasing frequency has been explored on other continents. Mammalian research has contributed significantly to the development of landscape ecology, demonstrating that responses to landscape structure are often taxon-, scale-, or context-dependent. Future research should consider hierarchical approaches that are scale-sensitive, with explicit linkage to contemporary hypotheses, thereby advancing theoretical understanding and informing management and conservation action. © 2019 American Society of Mammalogists.","Artiodactyla; Carnivora; Chiroptera; Lagomorpha; landscape composition; landscape configuration; Marsupialia; Rodentia; spatial scale","Anthropocene; bat; biome; carnivore; conservation management; conservation status; habitat conservation; heterogeneity; human activity; lagomorph; landscape ecology; landscape structure; marsupial; rodent; spatial analysis; wild population; Artiodactyla; Carnivora; Chiroptera; Lagomorpha; Mammalia; Metatheria; Rodentia","Abbas, F., Landscape fragmentation generates spatial variation of diet composition and quality in a generalist herbivore (2011) Oecologia, 167, pp. 401-411; Ahumada, J.A., Community structure and diversity of tropical forest mammals: Data from a global camera trap network (2011) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, B.
