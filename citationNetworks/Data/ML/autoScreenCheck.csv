The use of camera-trap data depends on the correct identification of animals captured in the photographs, yet misidentification rates can be high, especially when morphologically similar species co-occur, and this can lead to faulty inferences and hinder conservation efforts. Correct identification is dependent on diagnosable taxonomic characters, photograph quality, and the experience and training of the observer. However, keys rooted in taxonomy are rarely used for the identification of camera-trap images and error rates are rarely assessed, even when morphologically similar species are present in the study area. We tested a method for ensuring high identification accuracy using two sympatric and morphologically similar chipmunk (Neotamias) species as a case study. We hypothesized that the identification accuracy would improve with use of the identification key and with observer training, resulting in higher levels of observer confidence and higher levels of agreement among observers. We developed an identification key and tested identification accuracy based on photographs of verified museum specimens. Our results supported predictions for each of these hypotheses. In addition, we validated the method in the field by comparing remote-camera data with live-trapping data. We recommend use of these methods to evaluate error rates and to exclude ambiguous records in camera-trap datasets. We urge that ensuring correct and scientifically defensible species identifications is incumbent on researchers and should be incorporated into the camera-trap workflow. © 2021 The Authors.

Conservation culturomics promotes the use of user-generated online content in conservation science. Geotagged social media content is a unique source of in situ information on human presence and activities in nature. Photographs posted on social media platforms are a promising source of information, but analyzing large volumes of photographs manually remains laborious. We examined the application of state-of-the-art computer-vision methods to studying human–nature interactions. We used semantic clustering, scene classification, and object detection to automatically analyze photographs taken in Finnish national parks by domestic and international visitors. Our results showed that human–nature interactions can be extracted from user-generated photographs with computer vision. The different methods complemented each other by revealing broad visual themes related to level of the data set, landscape photogeneity, and human activities. Geotagged photographs revealed distinct regional profiles for national parks (e.g., preferences in landscapes and activities), which are potentially useful in park management. Photographic content differed between domestic and international visitors, which indicates differences in activities and preferences. Information extracted automatically from photographs can help identify preferences among diverse visitor groups, which can be used to create profiles of national parks for conservation marketing and to support conservation strategies that rely on public acceptance. The application of computer-vision methods to automatic content analysis of photographs should be explored further in conservation culturomics, particularly in combination with rich metadata available on social media platforms. © 2021 The Authors.

Despite their threatened status, the northeastern population of yellow-throated marten and their habitats are poorly studied, and limited information exists to aid recovery and conservation of this mesocarnivore. In this study, presence data of martens were analyzed using 23 raster datasets for MaxEnt and Biomapper modeling. We assessed resulting habitat models for yellow-throated marten in 773 of 10 × 10 km survey grids in South Korea using field sign and trail cameras in 2018 and 2019. With 2667 confirmed sightings of this species, we created the first distribution map of yellow-throated martens in South Korea. We then analyzed 13 environmental features related to marten occurrence using linear mixed-effects models. Our top models indicated that altitude, precipitation, seasonality, land cover, land price, rail, roads, tourism attractions, and traffic volume explained marten occurrence. Direct human activities were the most reliable indicators of disturbance rather than stationary features such as roads and buildings. Our results also suggest that yellow-throated martens can exist in areas of high human population density. The new ecological information we provide on the distribution and habitat relationships of yellow-throated martens in South Korea will be beneficial for management and conservation of this species in Southeast Asia. © 2021, Mammal Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, Bialowieza, Poland.","Biomapper; Detection/non-detection; Distribution; Habitat model; Martes flavigula; MaxEnt; South Korea; Yellow-throated marten","building; conservation management; disturbance; geographical distribution; mustelid; tourism; South Korea; Martes; Martes flavigula","Ascensão, F., Grilo, C., LaPoint, S., Tracey, J., Clevenger, A.P., Santos-Reis, M., Inter-individual variability of stone marten behavioral responses to a highway (2014) PLoS One, 9, pp. 1-9; Baldwin, R.A., Use of maximum entropy modeling in wildlife research (2009) Entropy, 11, pp. 854-866; Balestrieri, A., Bogliani, G., Boano, G., Ruiz-González, A., Saino, N., Costa, S., Milanesi, P., Modelling the distribution of forest-dependent species in human-dominated landscapes: patterns for the pine marten in intensively cultivated lowlands (2016) PLoS One, 11, pp. 1-14; Barja, I., Silván, G., Rosellini, S., Piñeiro, A., González-Gil, A., Camacho, L., Illera, J.C., Stress physiological responses to tourist pressure in a wild population of European pine marten (2007) J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol, 104, pp. 136-142; Boubli, J.P., De Lima, M.G., Modeling the geographical distribution and fundamental niches of Cacajao spp. and Chiropotes israelita in Northwestern Amazonia via a maximum entropy algorithm (2009) Int J Primatol, 30, pp. 217-228; Brainerd, S.M., Rolstad, J., Habitat selection by Eurasian pine martens Martes martes in managed forests of southern boreal Scandinavia (2002) Wildlife Biol, 8, pp. 289-297; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (2002) Model selection and multimodel inference, , Springer Science & Business Media, New York; Chutipong, W., Duckworth, J.W., Timmins, R.J., Martes flavigula (2016) IUCN Red List Threat.

At present, most flame detection methods use a single classifier and have achieved some results. However, a single classification algorithm has poor adaptability to fire detection in a variety of complex situations. Therefore, a multi-classifier fusion flame detection algorithm is proposed based on Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidence theory is proposed. In short, firstly four classifiers are used to classify the same flame feature, and the four classification results are fused to make preliminary decision. The four classifiers include support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT) and random forest (RF). Second, three complementary flame features are chosen, namely color, texture and shape changes. Finally, the preliminary decision results of the three features are fused to obtain the final classification result. It should be noted that when different classifiers have strong conflicts on the classification result of the same feature, the fusion rule of DS evidence theory will be invalid. To solve this problem, the DS evidence theory is improved. For the experiment, the public flame videos are collected to construct a data set including different complex scenes for algorithm verification, where the frame rate of the video is 15 or 24 frames/s and the resolution is 320 × 240. The experimental results show that there is a strong complementary among the results of different single classifier. The multi-classifier fusion algorithm can achieve better classification performance and robust performance than the single classifier by integrating the results of each classifier, and its average detection rate reaches 93.08%. In addition, for the changes of different environments, the proposed method has higher adaptability and stability than other state-of-art methods. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","complementary features; DS evidence theory; Flame detection; multi-classifier fusion","Decision trees; Nearest neighbor search; Signal detection; Support vector machines; Textures; Algorithm verification; Classification algorithm; Classification performance; Classification results; Dempster-Shafer evidence theory; Flame detection algorithm; K nearest neighbor (KNN); State-of-art methods; Classification (of information)","Akshay, T., Poonam, S., Hybrid approach to detect a fire based on motion color and edge (2015) Digital Image Processing, 7 (9); Alamgir, N., Nguyen, K., Chandran, V., Combining multi-channel color space with local binary co-occurrence feature descriptors for accurate smoke detection from surveillance videos (2018) Fire Safety Journal, 102 (DEC.), pp. 1-10; Cao, J.T., Qin, Y.Y., Ji, X.F., Review on video based flame detection algorithm (2020) J Data Acquisit Process, 1 (35), pp. 35-52; Chen, K., Li, Y.H., You, F., Smoke detection algorithm about video image with multiple features based on serial and parallel processing model (2017) Comput Moderniz, 4 (1), pp. 1-6; Chi, R., Lu, Z., Ji, M., Real-time multi-feature based fire flame detection in video (2017) Image Process, 11 (1), pp. 31-37; Choi, H.S., Moon, K.S., Kim, J.N., Park, S.S., Fire detection algorithm based on motion information and color information analysis (2016) J Korea Multimed Society, 19 (2), pp. 180-188; Emmy, P.C., Vinsley, S.S., Suresh, S., Multi feature analysis of smoke in YUV color space for early forest fire detection (2016) Fire Technol, 52 (5), pp. 1319-1342; Emmy, P.C., Vinsley, S.S., Suresh, S., Efficient flame detection based on static and dynamic texture analysis in forest fire detection (2017) Fire Technol, 8 (54), pp. 255-288; Foggia, P., Saggese, A., Vento, M., Real-time fire detection for video-surveillance applications using a combination of experts based on color, shape, and motion (2015) IEEE Trans Circuits Syst Video Technol, 9 (25), pp. 1545-1556; Han, X.F., Jin, J.S., Wang, M.J., Video fire detection based on Gaussian mixture model and multi-color features (2017) Signal Image Video P, 5, pp. 1-7; http://www.voidcn.com/article/p-aqyrfugn-brs.html, Accepted 06 June 2018; http://www.voidcn.com/article/p-pnamezca-bca.html, Accepted 30 March 2013; https://blog.csdn.net/qq_36512295/article/details/89448583, Accepted 30 April 2019; https://blog.csdn.net/zfcjhdq/article/details/515668755, Accepted 06 February 2016; https://wenku.baidu.com/view/a659291e7c1cfad6185fa79f.html, Accessed 30 June 2018; Liu, Y., Cheng, M.M., Fan, D.P., Semantic edge detection with diverse deep supervision (2019) IEEE Transaction on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, , TPAMI on 2018 Dec 26; Lu, C., Lu, M., Lu, X., Cai, M., Feng, X., Forest fire smoke recognition based on multiple feature fusion (2018) IOP Confer Series Mater Sci Eng, 435 (1); Minichino, J., Howse, J., Learning OpenCV computer vision with python (2015) Background Subtractor: KNN, MOG2 and GMG, , second edn, Ireland; Wang, L., Li, A.G., Early fire recognition based on multi-feature fusion of video (2017) Proceeding of the 36Th Chinese Control Conference, 7, pp. 26-28; Wang, T., Bu, L.P., Yang, Z.K., A new fire detection method using a multi-expert system based on color dispersion similarity and centroid motion in indoor environment (2020) IEEE/CAA J Autom Sinica, 1 (7), pp. 263-275; Wu, X.Y., Yan, Y.Y., Du, J., Fire detection based on fusion of multiple feature (2015) CAAI Transactions on Intelligent Systems, 10 (iceiti), pp. 1-8; Wu, X., Lu, X., Leung, H., A video based fire smoke detection using robust AdaBoost (2018) Sensors, 18 (11). , (,),., (,)., https://doi.org/10.3390/s18113780; Zeng, S.T., Wu, H.B., Shen, P.H., Video fire detection based on fusion of multiple features (2017) J Graph, 4 (38), pp. 549-557; Zhao, Q., Sun, F.D., Li, W.H., Flame detection using generic color model and improved block-based PCA in active infrared camera (2018) Int J Pattern Recognit Artif Intell, 5 (32), pp. 1-15; Zhao, J.X., Liu, J., Fan, D.P., EGNet:Edge guidance network for salient object detection. 2019 (2019) IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 8 (22), pp. 8779-8788; Zhao, J.X., Cao, Y., Fan, D.P., Contrast prior and fluid pyramid integration for rgbd salient object detection (2020) 2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), , https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2019.00405, IEEE","Article","Article in Press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088123022","../Data/LitSearches/ML/SCOPUSFinal/scopus(29).csv",1

This article describes a class of hierarchical models parameterised by neural networks – neural hierarchical models. The derivation of such models analogises the relationship between regression and neural networks. A case study is developed for a neural dynamic occupancy model of North American bird populations, trained on millions of detection/non-detection time series for hundreds of species, providing insights into colonisation and extinction at a continental scale. Flexible models are increasingly needed that scale to large data and represent ecological processes. Neural hierarchical models satisfy this need, providing a bridge between deep learning and ecological modelling that combines the function representation power of neural networks with the inferential capacity of hierarchical models. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS","Deep learning; hierarchical model; neural network; occupancy","artificial neural network; bridge; colonization; ecological modeling; extinction risk; hierarchical system; learning; time series analysis; Aves; ecology; Ecology; Neural Networks, Computer","Anderson, D., Burnham, K., (2004) Model Selection and Multi-Model Inference, p. 63. , &, Springer-Verlag, 2nd., NY, p; Austin, M., Spatial prediction of species distribution: An interface between ecological theory and statistical modelling (2002) Ecol.

An image is fed to Raspberry Pi, wherein we run a Python-based program with some dependencies, viz. TensorFlow, etc., to identify the animal/object from the image and classify it in appropriate category.

Mesocarnivores are abundant and diverse mid-sized carnivores and can have profound impacts on the function, structure and dynamics of ecosystem after the extirpation of apex predators in many ecosystems. The moist temperate forests of Southwest China harbor a diverse community of mesocarnivores in the absence of apex predators. Sympatric species tend to partition limited resources along time, diet and space to facilitate coexistence. We determined the spatial and temporal patterns for five species of mesocarnivores. We used detection histories from a large camera-trap dataset collected from 2004-2015 with an extensive effort of 23,313 camera-days from 495 camera locations. The five mesocarnivore species included masked palm civet Paguma larvata, leopard cat Prionailurus bengalensis, HOG badger Arctonyx collaris, yellow-throated marten Martes flavigula, and Siberian weasel Mustela sibirica. Only the masked palm civet and HOG badger tended to avoid each other; while for other pairs of species, they occurred independently of each other, or no clear pattern observed. With regard to seasonal activity, yellow-throated marten was most active in winter, opposite the pattern observed for masked palm civet, leopard cat and HOG badger. For diel activity, masked palm civet, leopard cat and HOG badger were primarily nocturnal and crepuscular; yellow-throated marten was diurnal, and Siberian weasel had no clear pattern for most of the year (March to November), but was nocturnal in the winter (December to February). The seasonal shift of the Siberian weasel may be due to the high diet overlap among species in winter. Our results provided new facts and insights into this unique community of mesocarnivores of southwest China, and will facilitate future studies on the mechanism determining coexistence of animal species within complex system.","","badger;

It also suggests that the emerging field of Animal–Computer Interaction (ACI) needs to reconsider what should be counted as interaction. The most common already established forms of interaction are direct and dyadic, and limited to domesticated animals such as working dogs and pets. Drawing on an ethnography of the use of mobile proximity sensor cameras in ordinary wild boar hunting we emphasize a more complex, diffuse, and not directly observable form of interaction, which involves wild animals in a technological and naturalistic setting. Investigating human and boar activities related to the use of these cameras in the light of Actor-Network Theory (ANT) and Goffman's notion of strategic interaction reveals a gamelike interaction that is prolonged, networked and heterogeneous, in which members of each species is opposed the other in a mutual assessment acted out through a set of strategies and counter-strategies. We stress the role of theory for the field of ACI and how conceptualizations of interaction can be used to excite the imagination and be generative for design. Seeing interaction as strategies and acknowledging the existence of complex interdependencies could potentially inspire the design of more indirect and non-dyadic interactions where a priori simplifications of design challenges as either human or animal can be avoided. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Actor-network theory; Animal–computer interaction; Ethnography; Ontological symmetry; Strategic interaction","Cameras; Complex networks; Social sciences computing; Actor network theory; Computer interaction; Computer research; Design challenges; Digital technologies; Dyadic interaction; Ethnography; Strategic interactions; Animals","Aspling, F., Juhlin, O., Smelling, pulling and looking: unpacking similarities and differences in dog and human city life (2015), In: Proceedings of the Second International Congress on Animal-Computer Interaction at ACE’15 (ACM); Ashmore, M., Behaviour modification of a catflap: a contribution to the sociology of things (1993) Kennis Methode, 17, pp. 214-229; Bannon, L., Bødker, S., Constructing common information spaces (1997) Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on CSC, pp. 81-96. , In: (ECSCW’97), pp; Bederson, Schneiderman, (2003) The Craft of Information Visualization: Readings and Reflections., , Morgan Kaufmann Publishers San Francisco; Brower, M., (2011) Developing Animals – Wildlife and Early American Photography, , University of Minnesota Press; Brown, B., Juhlin, O., (2015) Enjoying Machines, , MIT Press Cambridge, Massachusetts; Buller, H., Animal geographies II: methods (2015) Progr.

They show great promise as a general analytical framework for community ecology and macroecology, but current JSDMs, even when approximated by latent variables, scale poorly on large datasets, limiting their usefulness for currently emerging big (e.g. metabarcoding and metagenomics) community datasets. Here, we present a novel, more scalable JSDM (sjSDM) that circumvents the need to use latent variables by using a Monte Carlo integration of the joint JSDM likelihood together with flexible elastic net regularization on all model components. We implemented sjSDM in PyTorch, a modern machine learning framework, which allows making use of both CPU and GPU calculations. Using simulated communities with known species–species associations and different number of species and sites, we compare sjSDM with state-of-the-art JSDM implementations to determine computational runtimes and accuracy of the inferred species–species and species–environment associations. We find that sjSDM is orders of magnitude faster than existing JSDM algorithms (even when run on the CPU) and can be scaled to very large datasets. Despite the dramatically improved speed, sjSDM produces more accurate estimates of species association structures than alternative JSDM implementations. We demonstrate the applicability of sjSDM to big community data using eDNA case study with thousands of fungi operational taxonomic units (OTU). Our sjSDM approach makes the analysis of JSDMs to large community datasets with hundreds or thousands of species possible, substantially extending the applicability of JSDMs in ecology. We provide our method in an R package to facilitate its applicability for practical data analysis. © 2021 The Authors.

Using a deep neural network (DNN) model training for animal- background image classification, we analyze the input camera-trap images to generate a multi-level visual representation of the input image. We detect semantic regions of interest for animals from this representation using k-mean clustering and graph cut in the DNN feature domain. These animal regions are then classified into animal species using multi-class deep neural network model. According the experimental results, our method achieves 99.75% accuracy for classifying animals and background and 90.89% accuracy for classifying 26 animal species on the Snapshot Serengeti dataset, outperforming existing image classification methods. © 2019","Animal species classification; Deep neural networks; Graph cut; Semantic regions","artificial neural network; classification; data set; detection method; graphical method; image analysis; image classification; visual analysis; Animalia","Bowkett, A.E., Rovero, F., Marshall, A.R., The use of camera-trap data to model habitat use by antelope species in the udzungwa mountain forests, Tanzania (2008) Afr.

In the context of aquatic systems, we present a method for quasi-optimal network design, which accounts for blocking of detections by obstacles, horizontal and vertical movement behaviour of the target animals, and type of research question (is the network intended for estimation of detailed movement or home range?). Optimal design is defined as the sensor configuration that maximizes the expected number of unique animal detections. As finding the global optimum is generally time consuming, we use a greedy algorithm instead, which places sensors optimally relative to already placed sensors. The design method requires access to topographic data of the study site and knowledge of the sensor detection range. We illustrate the method with real topographic data from a rugose coral reef where network performance is highly influenced by detection shadowing. Network performance is visualized by a coverage map indicating the probability of detection at any location in the study area. The reported unique recovery rate summarizes the expected ability of the network to collect data given the design constraints. Because sensors are placed sequentially, the information gain per sensor can be evaluated and used as a proxy for sensor value. The presented method formalizes important considerations, when designing sensor networks, that were previously often based on heuristics and intuition. The method provides a guide to maximizing the information potential of future monitoring studies as well as a means to improve existing networks. The method is available as an R package and can be tested via an online web tool. © 2014 The Authors.","Animal movement; Bioacoustics; Camera traps; Detection function; Home range; Optimal design","Animalia; Anthozoa","Akbarzadeh, V., Gagné, C., Parizeau, M., Argany, M., Mostafavi, M.A., Probabilistic sensing model for sensor placement optimization based on line-of-sight coverage (2012) IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, 62, pp. 293-303; Biesinger, Z., Bolker, B.M., Marcinek, D., Grothues, T.M., Dobarro, J.A., Lindberg, W.J., Testing an autonomous acoustic telemetry positioning system for fine scale space use in marine animals (2013) Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 448, pp. 46-56; Blumstein, D.T., Mennill, D.J., Clemins, P., Girod, L., Yao, K., Patricelli, G., Acoustic monitoring in terrestrial environments using microphone arrays: applications, technological considerations and prospectus (2011) The Journal of Applied Ecology, 48, pp. 758-767; Deb, K., (2001) Multi-Objective Optimization Using Evolutionary Algorithms, 2012. , John Wiley & Sons, Chichester; Hansen, N., Ostermeier, A., Completely derandomized self-adaptation in evolution strategies (2001) Evolutionary Computation, 9, pp. 159-195; Honda, K., Hobday, A.J., Kawabe, R., Tojo, N., Fujioka, K., Takao, Y., Miyashita, K., Age-dependent distribution of juvenile southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) on the continental shelf off southwest Australia determined by acoustic monitoring (2010) Fisheries Oceanography, 19, pp. 151-158; Jackson, G.D., The development of the Pacific Ocean shelf tracking project within the decade long census of marine life (2011) PloS One, 6, p. e18999; Kessel, S., Cooke, S., Heupel, M., Hussey, N., Simpfendorfer, C., Vagle, S., Fisk, A., A review of detection range testing in aquatic passive acoustic telemetry studies (2013) Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries, 24, pp. 1-20; Klimley, A.P., MacFarlane, R.B., Sandstrom, P.T., Lindley, S.T., A summary of the use of electronic tagging to provide insights into salmon migration and survival (2013) Environmental Biology of Fishes, 96, pp. 419-428; Cormen, T.H., Leiserson, C.E., Rivest, R.L., Stein, C., (2001) Introduction to algorithms, , MIT Press, Cambridge; Marques, T.A., Thomas, L., Martin, S.W., Mellinger, D.K., Ward, J.A., Moretti, D.J., Harris, D., Tyack, P.L., Estimating animal population density using passive acoustics (2013) Biological Reviews, 88, pp. 287-309; Mennill, D.J., Doucet, S.M., Ward, K.-A., Maynard, D.F., Otis, B., Burt, J.M., A novel digital telemetry system for tracking wild animals: a field test for studying mate choice in a lekking tropical bird (2012) Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 3, pp. 663-672; Meyer, C.G., Papastamatiou, Y.P., Clark, T.B., Differential movement patterns and site fidelity among trophic groups of reef fishes in a Hawaiian marine protected area (2010) Marine Biology, 157, pp. 1499-1511; Pedersen, M.W., Weng, K.C., Estimating individual animal movement from observation networks (2013) Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 4, pp. 920-929; Rempel, R.S., Francis, C.M., Robinson, J.N., Campbell, M., Comparison of audio recording system performance for detecting and monitoring songbirds (2013) Journal of Field Ornithology, 84, pp. 86-97; Rowcliffe, J., Carbone, C., Jansen, P., Kays, R., Kranstauber, B., Quantifying the sensitivity of camera traps: an adapted distance sampling approach (2011) Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 2, pp. 464-476; Seminoff, J.A., Jones, T.T., Diel movements and activity ranges of Green turtle (Chelonia mydas) at a temperate foraging area in the Gulf of California, Mexico (2006) Herpetological Conservation and Biology, 1, pp. 81-86; Solomon, D., Potter, E., First results with a new estuarine fish tracking system (1988) Journal of Fish Biology, 33, pp. 127-132; Tobler, M., Carrillo-Percastegui, S., Leite Pitman, R., Mares, R., Powell, G., An evaluation of camera traps for inventorying large-and medium-sized terrestrial rainforest mammals (2008) Animal Conservation, 11, pp. 169-178; Van Laarhoven, P.J., Aarts, E.H., (1987) Simulated Annealing, , Springer, Netherlands; Welsh, J., Fox, R., Webber, D., Bellwood, D., Performance of remote acoustic receivers within a coral reef habitat: implications for array design (2012) Coral Reefs, 31, pp. 693-702; Weng, K.C., A pilot study of deepwater fish movement with respect to marine reserves (2013) Animal Biotelemetry, 1, pp. 1-9; Yeiser, B., Heupel, M., Simpfendorfer, C., Occurrence, home range and movement patterns of juvenile bull (Carcharhinus leucas) and lemon (Negaprion brevirostris) sharks within a Florida estuary (2008) Marine and Freshwater Research, 59, pp. 489-501","Article","Final","All Open Access, Bronze","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939139279","../Data/LitSearches/ML/SCOPUSFinal/scopus(29).csv",1

The unique pelage pattern of cheetahs allows for identification of individuals from photographs, providing detection histories that are naturally suited for abundance estimation using capture-recapture methods. Furthermore, the spatial location of photographic detections allows for the use of spatial capture-recapture models, which provide estimates of density. In this chapter, we describe aspects of cheetah ecology that should be considered when designing camera trapping surveys (e.g., social structure, natural densities, and home range size) to estimate cheetah density and provide guidance for future camera trap sampling and analysis. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Protecting destruction of crops from wild animals is very important for agrarian societies. We engineered pre-trained VGG19 convolution neural network (CNN) to detect live monkeys in images streamed in an image sequence generated from a USB webcam. We used transfer learning approach to custom train, YOLO, a much faster CNN architecture to detect monkeys. For training and analysis, we used the Google Open Images V4 dataset. We give details of how two significantly different architectures were customized for native monkey detection. The performance of the detectors developed is analysed in terms of time taken for detection and accuracy of detection. Custom trained architecture achieved high true positive rate of 97.19% and true negative rate of 95.32%, which are significantly higher and better than the pre-trained architecture.

Once widely distributed across China, only a maximum of 245 elephants are estimated to survive across seven small populations. We assessed the Asian elephant population in Nangunhe National Nature Reserve in Lincang Prefecture, China, using camera traps during May-July 2017, to estimate the population size and structure of this genetically important population. Although detection probability was low (0.31), we estimated a total population size of c. 20 individuals, and an effective density of 0.39 elephants per km2. Social structure indicated a strong sex ratio bias towards females, with only one adult male detected within the population. Most of the elephants associated as one herd but three adult females remained separate from the herd throughout the trapping period. These results highlight the fragility of remnant elephant populations such as Nangunhe and we suggest options such as a managed metapopulation approach for their continued survival in China and more widely.

Density is among the most useful metrics of population status because it is directly comparable across space and time. Unfortunately, density is difficult to measure reliably, especially for mobile, cryptic species. Recently, efforts have turned to approximating density based on its relationship to more readily estimable indices of occurrence. However, the relationship between density and such indices is contingent on several key assumptions that field studies often violate. Recent research has shown that these relationships are unreliable where sampling units are not independent, as is often the case when estimating density or occurrence of large carnivores. Here, we use the largest data set thus far collected for leopards (Panthera pardus)—88 camera-trap surveys undertaken in 24 protected areas between 2013 and 2018—to explore how density and other population characteristics relate to parameter estimates in occupancy and Royle–Nichols abundance models. We show how home-range size confounds underlying relationships, with larger home ranges inflating the proportion of area used (PAU) and resulting in double counting in abundance models. Relativizing estimates of occupancy and abundance by home-range size improved their relationship with density, but the relationship remained weak and largely uninformative for management. Our findings illustrate the pitfalls of using the PAU or abundance as implicit proxies for density and highlight the challenges of assessing population status for wide-ranging, cryptic species across fragmented landscapes. © 2019 The Authors.","carnivores;

Insights into these interactions can enhance understanding of local ecological processes that can have impacts on the recovery of endangered species, such as the ocelot (Leopardus pardalis). Ocelots, bobcats (Lynx rufus), and coyotes (Canis latrans) share a small geographic range overlap from South Texas to south-central Mexico but relationships among the three are poorly understood. From May 2011 to March 2018, we conducted a camera trap study to examine co-occurrence patterns among ocelots, bobcats, and coyotes on the East Foundation's El Sauz Ranch in South Texas. We used a novel multiseason extension to multispecies occupancy models with ≥2 interacting species to conduct an exploratory analysis to examine interspecific interactions and examine the potential effects of patch-level and landscape-level metrics relative to the occurrence of these carnivores. We found strong evidence of seasonal mutual coexistence among all three species and observed a species-specific seasonal trend in detection. Seasonal coexistence patterns were also explained by increasing distance from a high-speed roadway. However, these results have important ecological implications for planning ocelot recovery in the rangelands of South Texas. This study suggests a coexistence among ocelots, bobcats, and coyotes under the environmental conditions on the El Sauz Ranch. Further research would provide a better understanding of the ecological mechanisms that facilitate coexistence within this community. As road networks in the region expand over the next few decades, large private working ranches will be needed to provide important habitat for ocelots and other carnivore species. © 2020 The Authors.

Measuring objectively the number of different species of animals, plants, fungi, and microbes that make up the ecosystem can be difficult. In order to monitor changes in biodiversity, data have to be compared across space and time. Cameras are an essential sensor to determine the species range, abundance, and behavior of animals. The millions of recordings from camera traps set up in natural environments can no longer be analyzed by biologists. We started research on doing this analysis automatically without human interaction. The focus of our present sensor is on image capture of wildlife and moths. Special hardware elements for the detection of different species are designed, implemented, tested, and improved, as well as the algorithms for classification and counting of samples from images and image sequences, e.g., to calculate presence, absence, and abundance values or the duration of characteristic activities related to the spatial mobilities. For this purpose, we are developing stereo camera traps that allow spatial reconstruction of the observed animals. This allows three-dimensional coordinates to be recorded and the shape to be characterized. With this additional feature data, species identification and movement detection are facilitated. To classify and count moths, they are attracted to an illuminated screen, which is then photographed at intervals by a high-resolution color camera. To greatly reduce the volume of data, redundant elements and elements that are consistent from image to image are eliminated. All design decisions take into account that at remote sites and in fully autonomous operation, power supply on the one hand and possibilities for data exchange with central servers on the other hand are limited. Installation at hard-to-reach locations requires a sophisticated and demanding system design with an optimal balance between power requirements, bandwidth for data transmission, required service and operation in all environmental conditions for at least ten years. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","active learning; animal detection; anomaly detection; biodiversity monitoring; camera trapping with color and depth sensors; deep learning; depth estimation; fine-grained recognition; incremental learning; lifelong learning; motion estimation in color and depth videos; multi-object tracking; novelty detection; sensor networks; species classification","Animals; Biodiversity; Color; Deep learning; Electronic data interchange; Image enhancement; Motion estimation; Object detection; Sensor networks; Active Learning; Animal detection; Anomaly detection; Biodiversity monitoring; Camera trapping with color and depth sensor; Color sensors; Color video; Deep learning; Depth Estimation; Depth sensors; Depth videos; Fine grained; Fine-grained recognition; Incremental learning; Life long learning; Motion estimation in color and depth video; Multi-object tracking; Novelty detection; Sensors network; Species classification; Cameras","Apps, P., McNutt, J.W., How camera traps work and how to work them (2018) Afr.

Some coastal populations of Columbian black-tailed deer (O. h. columbianus) in California, USA, near urban development, however, are perceived as a nuisance and may be overabundant. To determine the density of a potential nuisance population in Marin County, California, we used a combination of fecal DNA surveys, camera stations, and 2 sources of ancillary data on wildlife observations. We estimated an average density of 18.3 deer/km2 (90% CI = 15.8–20.7) throughout Marin County during late summer and early fall, 2015 and 2016. Within the county, areas with intermediate human density (885 people/km2, 90% CI = 125–1,646) were associated with the highest deer densities (25–44/km2). Our estimate of average deer density was 1.7–6.1 times higher than published density estimates for deer from elsewhere in California and on the low end of densities reported for mule and white-tailed (O. virginianus) deer in regions where they routinely cause a nuisance to humans. High black-tailed deer densities in Marin County may be partially attributed to a paucity of large predators, but more investigation is warranted to evaluate the effects of a recent increase in coyotes (Canis latrans) on the deer population. Analyses of highway road kill rates and citizen science surveys suggest that the deer population in Marin County has been stable over the past 10 years. Our results demonstrate how robust estimation of deer density can inform human–wildlife conflict issues, not just managed hunting. © 2020 The Authors.

Camera traps can capture habitus images of ground-dwelling insects. However, currently sampling involves manually detecting and identifying specimens. Here, we test whether a convolutional neural network (CNN) can classify habitus images of ground beetles to species level, and estimate how correct classification relates to body size, number of species inside genera, and species identity. We created an image database of 65,841 museum specimens comprising 361 carabid beetle species from the British Isles and fine-tuned the parameters of a pretrained CNN from a training dataset. By summing up class confidence values within genus, tribe, and subfamily and setting a confidence threshold, we trade-off between classification accuracy, precision, and recall and taxonomic resolution. The CNN classified 51.9% of 19,164 test images correctly to species level and 74.9% to genus level. Average classification recall on species level was 50.7%. Applying a threshold of 0.5 increased the average classification recall to 74.6% at the expense of taxonomic resolution. Higher top value from the output layer and larger sized species were more often classified correctly, as were images of species in genera with few species. Fine-tuning enabled us to classify images with a high mean recall for the whole test dataset to species or higher taxonomic levels, however, with high variability. This indicates that some species are more difficult to identify because of properties such as their body size or the number of related species. Together, species-level image classification of arthropods from museum collections and ecological monitoring can substantially increase the amount of occurrence data that can feasibly be collected. These tools thus provide new opportunities in understanding and predicting ecological responses to environmental change. © 2019 The Authors.

The existing data survey identifies wild animals through visual interpretation. This process not only requires a long time, but also has the problem that the expertise of the investigator determines the reliability of the data. Recently, deep Learning in the field of image recognition has been detecting the object identification, object count, and the image description in the image with high accuracy. In this paper, we introduce the camera trap data processor (AniWatch) which can automatically database wildlife identification, animal count, and motion information by deep learning. To test the software performance, the Sobaeksan national park's Jukryong eco-corridor was selected as a study area. First, we collected the camera trap data in the area. Since we need to detect moving objects in a fixed position, we performed data preprocessing through computer vision algorithms. Through the image tracking algorithm, the minimum bounding rectangle of the wild animal object was detected, and each frame was saved as an image. Because each image is of different size and resolution, we adjusted it to 100 × 100-pixel sizes to recognize it as training data. For deep learning, we applied a convolutional neural network (CNN) technique which is used in the image recognition field. Open source libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras) were used to implement the model, and the software was developed as a GUI application through Python. In the test results, AniWatch confirmed that it could reduce the time required for visual interpretation and minimize human errors. In the future, we will provide an automatic calculator of monitoring statistics by inputting camera trap data. © 2018 Proceedings - 39th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing: Remote Sensing Enabling Prosperity, ACRS 2018","Convolutional neural network; Image recognition; Jukryong eco-corridor; Species identification","Animals; Application programs; Automation; Cameras; Conservation; Convolution; Image recognition; Neural networks; Object detection; Open source software; Open systems; Remote sensing; Software testing; Automatic identification; Computer vision algorithms; Convolutional neural network; Jukryong eco-corridor; Minimum bounding rectangle; Open-source libraries; Species identification; Visual interpretation; Deep learning","Minichino, J., Howse, J., (2015) Learning OpenCV 3 Computer Vision with Python - Second Edition, pp. 258-294. , Packt Publishing, UK; Norouzzadeh, M.S., Nguyen, A., Kosmala, M., Swanson, A., Palmer, M., Packer, C., Clune, J., Automatically identifying, counting, and describing wild animals in camera-trap images with deep learning (2018) Proc.

We used camera traps and remotely sensed data to assess the spatial and temporal relationships between cattle and Andean bears (Tremarctos ornatus) in the Laquipampa Wildlife Refuge, a protected area in northwest Peru where cattle grazing is widespread. Between August 2015 and March 2016, we deployed 122 camera traps at 61 stations to measure the effect of cattle on the distribution and activity of Andean bears during the dry and humid seasons. We used generalized linear models to test the effects of cattle, other anthropogenic disturbances, and natural habitat variation on bear occurrence. We also estimated the degree of overlap between daily activity patterns of bears and cattle. We found a negative association between bears and cattle, and between bears and humans and dogs, and found that bears were less likely to use portions of the park closer to towns and farms. Bear responses to human disturbances were stronger than to habitat variation, and their spatial avoidance of cattle was stronger during the dry season. There was high overlap in daily activity patterns between bears and cattle, and bears and humans and dogs, suggesting the potential for interactions where they co-occur. Given the threatened status of Andean bears, and the role of protected areas in their conservation, we highlight the need for effective management of cattle and associated disturbances to protect this ecologically and culturally important carnivore. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde.","Carnivore; Dry forest conservation; Human–wildlife interactions; Overlap","","Agostinelli, C., Lund, U., (2013) R Package “circular”: Circular Statistics, , https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/circular/circular.pdf; Angulo, F., Flanagan, J.N.M., Vellinga, W.-P., Durand, N., Notes on the birds of Laquipampa Wildlife Refuge, Lambayeque (2012) Peru.

We see it being applied for credit decisions, insurance quotes, malware detection, fraud detection, email composition, and any other area having enough information to allow the machine to learn patterns. Over the years the number of sensors, cameras and cognitive pieces of equipment placed in the wilderness have been growing exponentially. However, the resources(human) to leverage these data into something meaningful are not improving at the same rate. For instance, a team of scientist volunteers took 8.4 years, 17000 hours at a rate of 40 hours/week to label 3.2 million images from the Serengeti wild park for our research, we are going to focus on wild data, and keep proving that deep learning can do better and faster than the human equivalent labour for the same task. Moreover, this is also an opportunity to present some custom Capsule Networks architectures to the deep learning community while solving the above-mentioned critical problem. Incidentally, we are going to take advantage of these data to make a comparative study on multiple Deep learning models. Specifically, VGG-net, RES-net and a custom made Convolutional-Capsule Network. We benchmark our work with the Serengeti project where Mohammed Mohammed Sadegh et al. recently published a 92% top-1 accuracy [15] and Gomez et al. had a 58% top-1 accuracy [8]. We successfully reached 96.4%) top-1 accuracy on the same identification task. Concurrently, we reach up to 79.48% top-1 testing accuracy on a big complex dataset using capsule network, which out-perform the best results of Capsule networks on a complex dataset from Edgar Xi et al. with 71% testing accuracy [5,23,18]. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Big data; Computer science; Computer vision; Ecosystem; Machine learning","Big data; Complex networks; Computer science; Computer vision; Convolutional neural networks; Data handling; Ecosystems; Information analysis; Learning systems; Statistical tests; Comparative studies; Critical problems; Fraud detection; Learning community; Learning models; Malware detection; Testing accuracy; Deep learning","Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G.E., ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural network (2017) Communications of the ACM; Szegedy, C., Vanhoucke, V., Ioffe, S., Shlens, J., (2015) Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision, , ILSVRC; Szegedy, C., Liu, W., Jia, Y., Sermanet, P., Reed, S., Anguelov, D., Erhan, D., (2014) Going Deeper with Convolutions, , September ILSVRC14; (2015) Deep Learning Tutorial Release 0.1, , LISA Lab, University of Montreal, March 09; Xi, E., Blind, S., Jin, Y., (2017) Capsule Network Performance on Complex Data, , December arXiv; Hinton, G.E., Sabour, S., Frosst, N., Dynamic routing between capsules (2015) 31st Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, , NIPS; Gering, D., (2002) Linear and Nonlinear Data Dimensionality Reduction, Fulfilment of the Area Exam Doctoral Requirements; Gomez, A., Diez, G., Salazar, A., Diaz, A., Animal identification in low-quality camera-trap images using very deep convolutional neural networks and confidence thresholds (2016) 2016 International Symposium on Visual Computing, pp. 747-756. , (Springer, Cham, Switzerland); http://tensorflow.com; https://www.udacity.com, Deep Learning Nano-degree; DiCarlo, J.J., Zoccolan, D., Rust, N.C., (2012) How Does the Brain Solve Visual Object Recognition?, , NIH; Schimdhuber, J., Deep Learning in Neural Networks: An Overview, , (Technical Report IDSIA-03-14); Simonyan, K., Zisserman, A., Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition (2017) Conference Paper at ICLR 2015, , ICLR; Misha, (2018) Capsule Networks for Food Classification, , February Medium.com; Nourouzzadeh, M.S., Nguyen, A., Kosmala, M., Swanson, A., Palmer, M., Packer, C., Clune, J., Automatically identifying, counting and describing wild animal in camera trap images with deep learning Communications of the ACM; Natxiromics, , https://github.com/naturomics/CapsNetTensorflow/blob/master/imgs/capsuleVSneuron.png; Vincent, P., Larochelle, H., Lajoie, I., Bengio, Y., Manzagol, P.-A., Stacked denoising autoencoders: Learning useful representations in a deep network with a local denoising criterion (2010) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 11 (2010), pp. 3371-3408; Mukhometzianov, R., Carrillo, J., CapsNet Comparative Performance Evaluation for Image Classification, , (arXiv); Schapire, R., COS 511: Theoretical Machine Learning, , Princeton.edu; Karayev, S., Baumgartner, T., Fritz, M., Darrel, T., Timely Object Recognition, , (NDSEG); Stanford Tutorial, , http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/StackedAutoencoders; Iesmantas, T., Alzbutas, R., Convolutional Capsule Network for Classification of Breast Cancer Histology Images, , (arXiv); UCI Machine Learning Repository, , http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml, Irvine, CA: University of California, School of Information and Computer Science; Liu, X., Xu, F., Sun, Y., Zhang, H., Chen, Z., Convolutional recurrent neural networks for observation-centered plant identification (2018) Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering; Zhao, Z.-Q., Zheng, P., Xu, S.-T., Wu, X., (2017) Object Detection with Deep Learning: A Review, , March journal of Latex","Conference Paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064923244","../Data/LitSearches/ML/SCOPUSFinal/scopus(29).csv",1

This change becomes particularly apparent in domains where humans and machines collaboratively work on joint tasks or objects in teams, such as in industrial assembly or disassembly processes. While there is intensive research work on human–machine collaboration in different research disciplines, systematic and interdisciplinary approaches towards engineering systems that consist of or comprise human–machine teams are still rare. In this paper, we review and analyze the state of the art, and derive and discuss core requirements and concepts by means of an illustrating scenario. In terms of methods, we focus on how reciprocal trust between humans and intelligent machines is defined, built, measured, and maintained from a systems engineering and planning perspective in literature. Based on our analysis, we propose and outline three important areas of future research on engineering and operating human–machine teams for trusted collaboration. For each area, we describe exemplary research opportunities. © 2020 by the authors.

Seabirds are considered important bioindicators of the oceans, but accessing breeding populations can be difficult, expensive and time consuming. New technologies have been employed to facilitate data collection on seabirds that can reduce costs and minimize disturbance. Among these, the use of time-lapse photography is a potentially effective way to reduce researcher effort, while collecting valuable information on key ecological parameters. However, the feasibility of this approach remains uncertain. Here, we assessed the use of time-lapse photography as a tool for estimating foraging behaviour from breeding seabirds, and evaluate ways forward for this method. We deployed cameras in front of active nests at a colony of black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) during two breeding seasons, 5 nests in 2013 and 5 in 2014, taking pictures every 4 minutes. A subsample of monitored individuals were also equipped with accelerometers. Approximately 100,000 frames, covering incubation and chick-rearing periods, were analysed. Estimates of foraging trip duration from images were positively correlated with accelerometry estimates (R2 = 0.967). Equal partitioning of effort between pairs, predation events, nest attendance patterns and variation in trip metrics with breeding stage were also identified. Our results suggest that time-lapse photography is potentially a useful tool for assessing foraging trip duration and other fine-scale nesting ecology parameters as well as for assessing the effect of bio-logging devices on seabird foraging behaviour. Nevertheless, the time investment to manually extract data from images was high, and the process to set up cameras was not straightforward. To encourage wide use of time-lapse photography in seabird ecology, we thus provide guidelines for camera deployment and we suggest a need for further development of automated approaches to allow data extraction. © 2018 De Pascalis et al.

Most current localization systems use cellular base stations and Wifi signals, whose localization accuracy is largely dependent on the signal strength and is sensitive to environmental changes. With the development of camera-based technologies, image-based localization may be employed in an indoor environment where the GPS signal is weak. Most of the existing image-based localization systems are based on color images captured by cameras, but this is only feasible in environments with adequate lighting conditions. In this paper, we introduce an image-based localization system based on thermal imaging to make the system independent of light sources, which are especially useful during emergencies such as a sudden power outage in a building. As thermal images are not obtained as easily as color images, we apply active transfer learning to enrich the thermal image classification learning, where normal RGB images are treated as the source domain, and thermal images are the target domain. The application of active transfer learning avoids random target training sample selection and chooses the most informative samples in the learning process. Through the proposed active transfer learning, the query thermal images can be accurately used to indicate the location. Experiments show that our system can be efficiently deployed to perform indoor localization in a dark environment. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Active transfer learning; Image-based localization; Thermal imaging","Cameras; Image classification; Infrared imaging; Learning systems; Light sources; Outages; Cellular base stations; Current localization; Environmental change; Image-based localizations; Indoor localization; Localization accuracy; Training sample selection; Transfer learning; Indoor positioning systems; accuracy; Article; building; classification; electricity; environmental factor; experimental study; image analysis; image based indoor localization system; image processing; image quality; imaging system; learning style; priority journal; thermal imaging","Sattler, T., Leibe, B., Kobbelt, L., Fast image-based localization using direct 2d-to-3d matching (2011) International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 667-674; Robertson, D., Cipolla, R., An image-based system for urban navigation (2004) British Machine Vision Conference, pp. 819-828; Schindler, G., Brown, M., Szeliski, R., City-scale location recognition (2007) IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 1-7; Nister, D., Stewenius, H., Scalable recognition with a vocabulary tree (2006) IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2, pp. 2161-2168; Xiao, J., Chen, J., Yeung, D., Quan, L., Structuring visual words in 3d for arbitrary-view object localization (2008) European Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 725-737; Crandall, D., Owens, A., Snavely, N., Huttenlocher, D., Discrete-continuous optimization for large-scale structure from motion (2011) IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 3001-3008; Li, Y., Snavely, N., Huttenlocher, D.P., Location recognition using prioritized feature matching (2010) European Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 791-804; Irschara, A., Zach, C., Frahm, J., Bischof, H., From structure-from-motion point clouds to fast location recognition (2009) IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 2599-2606; Gronat, P., Obozinski, G., Sivic, J., Pajdla, T., Learning and calibrating per-location classifiers for visual place recognition (2013) IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 907-914; Ravi, N., Shankar, P., Frankel, A., Elgammal, A., Iftode, L., Indoor localization using camera phones (2006) 7th IEEE Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications, pp. 49-49; Kosecka, J., Zhou, L., Barber, P., Duric, Z., Qualitative image based localization in indoors environments (2003) IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2, pp. 2-3; Liu, J., Chen, Y., Zhang, Y., Transfer regression model for indoor 3d location estimation (2010) Advances in Multimedia Modeling; Kawaji, H., Hatada, K., Yamasaki, T., Aizawa, K., Image-based indoor positioning system: fast image matching using omnidirectional panoramic images (2010) ACM International Workshop on Multimodal Pervasive Video Analysis, pp. 1-4; Wannous, H., Dovgalecs, V., Mégret, R., Daoudi, M., Place recognition via 3d modeling for personal activity lifelog using wearable camera (2012) Advances in Multimedia Modeling; Li, X., Wang, J., Image matching techniques for vision-based indoor navigation systems: performance analysis for 3d map based approach (2012) International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation, pp. 1-8; Yu, S., Yang, Y., Hauptmann, A., Harry potter[U+05F3]s marauder[U+05F3]s map: localizing and tracking multiple persons-of-interest by nonnegative discretization (2013) IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Sun, Z., Chen, Y., Qi, J., Liu, J., Adaptive localization through transfer learning in indoor wi-fi environment (2008) Seventh International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications, pp. 331-336; Jiang, W., Zavesky, E., Chang, S.-F., Loui, A., Cross-domain learning methods for high-level visual concept classification (2008) IEEE International Conference on Image Processing, pp. 161-164; Shi, X., Fan, W., Ren, J., Actively transfer domain knowledge (2008) Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases, pp. 342-357; Xu, Z., Jin, R., Yang, H., King, I., Lyu, M., Simple and efficient multiple kernel learning by group lasso (2010), pp. 1175-1182. , ICML; Seok, H.-S., Hwang, K.-B., Zhang, B.-T., Feature relevance network-based transfer learning for indoor location estimation (2011) IEEE Trans.

To accomplish that we placed 49 camera traps activated by heat and motion at Rio Preto State Park (RPSP) and 48 at Sempre Vivas National Park (SVNP). We also collected data on three environmental variables: vegetation physiognomy, elevation and wildfire frequency, to evaluate the influence of these factors on species richness and use intensity (inferred from camera trap detection rate) by large mammals. We recorded 23 large mammal species in the two parks combined. The lowest species richness was found at the rupestrian habitat of RPSP, and in the open grasslands of SVNP. The forest and savannah physiognomies were used more intensively by large mammals. Species richness was higher and use was greater at lower elevations of RPSP. In SVNP, fire frequency did not affect species richness or use intensity. The savannah habitat had very similar richness compared to the forests of the two protected areas. The high species richness and use intensity observed in these forest habitats highlights the importance of riparian environments in the Cerrado biome. The highest species richness and use intensity observed at low elevation follows patterns found in the literature, probably due to variation in the vegetation, which results in greater resource availability. Although rupestrian habitats at high elevations of the Espinhaço Range are known to have a high degree of endemism for some taxa, large mammal richness and use were not high in this habitat. These results indicate that the protection of native vegetation at lower elevations is crucial for the long-term conservation of large mammals in the Espinhaço Range. © 2017, Sociedade Brasileira de Zoologia.

In Sicily the wildcat lives in a wide range of habitats; this study was done on Mount Etna. Previous camera trap monitoring was conducted in 2006 (pilot study) and in 2007 (first estimation of wildcat population size by using camera trapping with capture-recapture analyses) in the same study area. In 2009 digital camera traps in pairs were used at each station with the aim of determining the density of the wildcat's population by using capture-recapture analyses. The coat-colour and markings system was used to determine both the taxonomical status of the photographed cat and the individual identification. Two trap-lines adjacent to each other were run in two consecutive data collection periods. Camera traps worked together for 1080 trap-days and we obtained 42 pictures of wildcats from 32 events of photographic capture, from which 10 individuals (excluding four kittens) were identified. The history capture of each individual was constructed and the software CAPTURE (model heterogeneity) was used to generate an estimation of the population density (0.28 ± 0.1 wildcat/1 Km2) by using the Full Mean Maximum Distance Moved for wildcats caught more than once to calculate the effective sampled area. The wildcat's population density on Mount Etna falls within the medium/high range of those found throughout Europe. Recaptures of the same individual and reproductions events have been recorded across the years. Comparison with previous studies suggested that wildcat's density in our study area might be stable. © 2012 S. Anile, C. Amico, B.

However, their effectiveness in the Australian context has been only minimally researched. Increased understanding of detection dog accuracy and efficacy is required for their inclusion in survey guidelines used by proponents of referred actions potentially impacting Australia's threatened mammals. Evaluation of new methods is also important for advancing population monitoring, particularly for threatened species. Aims: To determine the efficacy of wildlife detection dogs as a survey tool for low-density, cryptic species, using northern (Dasyurus hallucatus) and spotted-tailed (D. maculatus) quolls as subjects. We compared detection dogs, human search effort and camera trapping results, in simulated accuracy and efficacy trials, and field surveys. Methods: Two wildlife detection dogs' scores for sensitivity (ability to identify a target species scat) and specificity (ability to distinguish target from non-target species scats) were calculated during accuracy trials. The dogs were tested using 288 samples, of which 32 were targets, where northern and spotted-tailed quoll scat were the targets in separate trials. Survey efficacy was determined following completing 12 simulated surveys (6 per target species) involving a single, randomly placed scat sample in a 1-1.5 ha search area. During the northern quoll simulated surveys the dogs' survey efficacy was compared with that of a human surveyor. The dogs also undertook field surveys for both northern and spotted-tailed quolls, in conjunction with camera trapping for comparison. Key results: During accuracy trials the dogs had an average sensitivity and specificity respectively of 100% and 98.4% for northern quoll, and 100% and 98% for spotted-tailed quoll. Their average search time in efficacy trials for northern quoll was 11.07 min (significantly faster than the human surveyor), and 2.98 min for spotted-tailed quoll in the 1-1.5 ha search areas. During field surveys, northern quoll scats were detected at sites where camera trapping failed to determine their presence. No spotted-tailed quoll scat was detected by the dogs during field surveys. Conclusions: Trained and experienced detection dogs can work very accurately and efficiently, which is vital to their field success. Detection dogs are therefore capable of detecting evidence of species presence where alternative methods may be unsuccessful. Implications: Our study supports the future use of highly trained detection dogs for wildlife surveys and monitoring in Australia. Our results demonstrate that detection dogs can be highly accurate and are a beneficial stand-alone or complimentary method. © 2021 CSIRO.","accuracy; detection dogs; efficacy; field surveys; quolls","accuracy assessment; brownfield site; canid; detection method; endangered species; environmental monitoring; guideline; marsupial; native species; training; trapping; Australia; Dasyurus; Dasyurus hallucatus; Dasyurus maculatus; Mammalia","Austin, C., Tuft, K., Ramp, D., Cremona, T., Webb, J.

However, there are few pandas in the field and many useless data are also captured by the infrared camera, which brings many difficulties to the detection of the panda image. In order to quickly find the panda image from a large number of images, this paper proposes a special method of fast detection of giant panda based on the WL-SSD (wavelet feature single shot multibox detection) network using Spatial domain and frequency domain feature. The algorithm extracts the frequency domain features of the giant panda image through wavelet feature network. The experimental results show that the giant panda detection algorithm proposed in this paper better use of the high frequency characteristics of the giant panda texture feature, and it can find the panda image in high accuracy and detection rate from a large number of images. © 2020 IEEE.","Convolutional neural network (CNN); Object detection; Single Shot MultiBox Detection (SSD); Wavelet transform","Frequency domain analysis; Infrared devices; Signal detection; Temperature indicating cameras; Textures; Detection algorithm; Detection rates; Frequency domains; High frequency characteristics; Infra-red cameras; Spatial domains; Texture features; Wavelet features; Feature extraction","Yanagisawa, H., Yamashita, T., Watanabe, H., A study on object detection method from manga images using cnn (2018) 2018 International Workshop on Advanced Image Technology (IWAIT), pp. 1-4. , Chiang Mai; Zhu, B., Wu, X., Yang, L., Shen, Y., Wu, L., Automatic detection of books based on faster r-cnn (2016) 2016 Third International Conference on Digital Information Processing, Data Mining, and Wireless Communications (DIPDMWC), pp. 8-12. , Moscow; LeCun, Y., Bengio, Y., Convolutional networks for images, speech, and time series (1995) The Handbook of Brain Theory and Neural Networks, 3361 (10), p. 1995; Liu, W., Anguelov, D., Erhan, D., Szegedy, C., Reed, S., Fu, C.-Y., SSD: Single shot multibox detector (2016) Proc.

A significant intensification of agricultural practices led to a landscape transformation that reduced leveret survival by increasing negative factors such as predation pressure. Habitat improvement by means of wildflower strips has yielded some positive effects on European hare population trends, probably by improving food supply and providing year-round cover from predation. For this study, remote cameras were used to examine relationships between landscape and wildflower strip variables and the frequency of predator visits to wildflower strips as well as the probability of them visiting core areas of the strips. Of a total of 1586 visits of potential predators to wildflower strips, 91% were mammals and 9% were birds. Predators were more frequently observed at the edges of the wildflower strips than in their cores (72% of visits by mammalian predators and 76% by avian predators were at the edge). The results revealed that the frequency of observing predators was negatively correlated with adjacent crop height and the distance of the wildflower strip from settlements, roads and forests or hedgerows. The probability of a predator penetrating the core of the wildflower strip was negatively correlated with the vegetation cover, especially with the cover of wood, herbaceous plant species and teasel (Dipsacus fullonum). Appropriate management of wildflower strips by considering their spatial placement, creating low margin to surface area ratios and promoting heterogeneous wildflower structure can thus lead to reduced predator pressure on leverets as well as on ground-nesting birds. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Agri-environment schemes; Agriculture; Camera-trapping; European hare (Lepus europaeus); Predator behaviour; Wildflower strips","","Arnold, T.W., Uninformative Parameters and Model Selection Using Akaike’s Information Criterion (2010) J Wildl Manag, 74, pp. 1175-1178. , https://doi.org/10.2193/2009-367; Aschwanden, J., Holzgang, O., Jenni, L., Importance of ecological compensation areas for small mammals in intensively farmed areas (2007) Wildlife Biol, 13 (2), pp. 150-158; Averianov, A., Niethammer, J., Pegel, J.M., Lepus europaeus Pallas, 1778—Feldhase (2003) Handbuch der Säugetiere Europas, pp. 35-104. , Krapp F, (ed), Aula-Verlag, Wiebelsheim; Barton, K., (2017) Model selection and model averaging based on information criteria (AICc and alike), , https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MuMIn/MuMIn.pdf, Accessed 7 Nov 2017; Bates, D., Maechler, M., Bolker, B., Walker, S., Fitting linear mixed-effects models using lme4 (2015) J Stat Softw, 67 (1), pp. 1-48; Baumann, M., (2003) Pflugfurchenprojekt” zur Förderung des Feldhasen in der Solothurner Witi.

More monitoring and research are needed to better inform land managers tasked with both managing for biodiversity and managing the threat of bushfires. Aims: To document changes in the activity of native and introduced mammal species in response to planned burns in a small, isolated woodland reserve in Tasmania. Methods: Over a 10-year period, mammal activity was monitored before and after two separate moderate-intensity planned burns in 20-ha management blocks and in unburnt blocks of similar size by using live-trapping and camera-trapping. Vegetation density was monitored concurrently, and we also searched burnt areas for animals killed by fire. Key results: The activity of most mammal populations was largely unaffected by the two planned burns. However, during one of the burns, over 20 rufous-bellied pademelons were directly killed as a result of a need to conduct a backburn. The population recovered after 3 years. The activity of red-necked wallabies, common brushtail possums and short-beaked echidnas generally increased across the whole study area during the 10-year monitoring period. Limited evidence suggests that eastern barred bandicoot and European rabbit activity increased after fire. No swamp rat activity was recorded in burnt areas following the planned burns. Unexpectedly they did not recolonise burnt areas and also ceased to be active in control areas for the last 3 years of the study we hypothesise that this may be due to the increased dryness and thinning of vegetation. Conclusions: We found that most of the mammal populations within this small, isolated reserve were resilient to the planned burning program, with no or limited short-term effect for all but one species. The absence of swamp rats from burnt or unburnt areas for the last 3 years of our study suggests that factors other than fire are also affecting this species. Implications: Planned burning is an important tool for biodiversity conservation, but its use needs to be underpinned by empirical data because mammal fire responses are likely to be site-, time- and context-specific. © CSIRO 2021 Open Access CC BY.","camera-trapping; fire management; introduced species; live-trapping; marsupials; rodents; Tasmania","conservation planning; nature reserve; small mammal; woodland; Macropodidae; Mammalia; Metatheria; Oryctolagus cuniculus; Perameles gunnii; Phalangeridae; Rodentia; Scapteromys tumidus; Tachyglossidae; Tasmania; Thylogale","Arthur, A.

Guwahati, the largest city of North-Eastern part of India experiences the human-leopard conflict from last few decades. Studies advocate that once this region was a suitable abode for many animal species, especially for the leopards. But the growing urban built-up progressively shrinks the suitable habitation site for this species that leading to the frequent conflicts between man and leopard within the city region. Rapid decrease of leopard population and increasing incidences of encounters are the major concern for the sustainable conservation of the species. In this study, an effort has been made to evaluate the habitat suitability of leopards in Guwahati city region by using composite score method. Four parameters are considered to perform the spatial analysis such as leopard conflict locations collected using camera traps, pug marks/scat, and conflict locations; spatial distribution of population derived from LandscanTM population data; land use/ land cover data classified using Landsat 8 OLI satellite imagery and elevation information extracted from SRTM Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Results of the analysis suggests that the region near Fatasil hill, Japorigog hill and areas of Amsang Reserve forest as the most suitable habitat for the leopards. Outcome of this study will help the people living within or near those region to avoid possible encounters, while it will also help the concerned authorities to take adequate steps for the conservation of the species as well as the habitats. © 2020 SERSC.","Composite score; Guwahati city; Habitat-suitability; Human-Leopard conflict (HEC); Spatial analysis","","Saikia, A., Hazarika, R., Sahariah, D., Land-use/land-cover change and fragmentation in the Nameri Tiger Reserve, India (2013) Geogr.

Two mustelid species-the American mink and common marten-are predominant in the Southern Urals. In summer and autumn, the American mink prefers brooks emptying into large rivers, whereas the common marten is more frequently met along banks of forest brooks and rivers with channel widths not exceeding 3 m. Whereas in usual conditions we observe spatial segregation between different mustelid species, extreme situations force mustelids to form multispecies communities on the banks of water bodies, where a mutual avoidance is reached by the temporal segregation strategy of circadian activity. © 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","American mink; common marten; noninvasive methods; spatial arrangement; the Southern Urals; trail cameras","dominance; forest ecosystem; mustelid; population distribution; seasonal variation; spatial analysis; species diversity; Urals","Beja-Pereira, A., Oliveira, R., Alves, P.C., Schwartz, M.K., Luikart, G., Advancing ecological understandings through technological transformations in noninvasive genetics (2009) Mol.

However, traditional analytical approaches to camera trap data are difficult to apply to visible wildlife characteristics in single images, such as infection status. Several parasites produce visible signs of infection that could be sampled via camera traps. Sarcoptic mange Sarcoptes scabiei is an ideal disease to study using cameras because it results in visible hair loss and affects a broad host range. Here, we developed a multi-state occupancy model to estimate the occurrence of mange in coyotes Canis latrans across an urban gradient. This model incorporates a secondary detection function for apparent by-image infection status to provide detection-corrected estimates of mange occurrence. We analysed a multi-year camera trap dataset in Chicago, Illinois, United States, to test whether the apparent occurrence of sarcoptic mange in coyotes Canis latrans increases with urbanization or varies through time. We documented visible signs consistent with current or recovering mange infection and variables we hypothesized would improve mange detection: The proportion of the coyote in frame, image blur and whether the image was in colour. We were more likely to detect coyotes with mange in images that were less blurry, in colour, and if a greater proportion of the coyote was visible. Mangy coyote occupancy was significantly higher in urban developed areas with low housing density and higher canopy cover whereas coyote occupancy, mangy or otherwise, decreased with urbanization. By incorporating image quality into our by-image detection function, we provide a robust method to non-invasively survey visible aspects of wildlife health with camera traps. Apparently mangy coyotes were associated with low-density forested neighbourhoods, which may offer vegetated areas while containing sources of anthropogenic resources. This association may contribute to human–wildlife conflict and reinforces posited relationships between infection risk and habitat use. More generally, our model could provide detection-corrected occupancy estimates of visible characteristics that vary by image such as body condition or injuries. © 2021 British Ecological Society","camera trap; coyote; detectability; occupancy models; sarcoptic mange; urbanization; wildlife disease","health status; image analysis; model; videography; wildlife management; Canis latrans; Sarcoptes scabiei; Varanidae; animal; coyote; human; Sarcoptes scabiei; scabies; urbanization; veterinary medicine; wild animal; Animals; Animals, Wild; Coyotes; Humans; Sarcoptes scabiei; Scabies; Urbanization","Almberg, E.S., Cross, P.C., Dobson, A.P., Smith, D.W., Metz, M.C., Stahler, D.R., Hudson, P.J., Social living mitigates the costs of a chronic illness in a cooperative carnivore (2015) Ecology Letters, 18, pp. 660-667. , https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.12444; Baker, P.J., Funk, S.M., Harris, S., White, P.C.L., Flexible spatial organization of urban foxes, Vulpes vulpes, before and during an outbreak of sarcoptic mange (2000) Animal Behaviour, 59, pp. 127-146. , https://doi.org/10.1006/anbe.1999.1285; Carricondo-Sanchez, D., Odden, M., Linnell, J.D.C., Odden, J., The range of the mange: Spatiotemporal patterns of sarcoptic mange in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) as revealed by camera trapping (2017) PLoS ONE, 12 (4), pp. 1-16. , https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0176200; (2018) High-resolution Land Cover, NE Illinois and NW Indiana, , https://datahub.cmap.illinois.gov/dataset/high-resolution-land-cover-ne-illinois-and-nw-indiana-2010, Retrieved from; Colvin, M.E., Peterson, J.T., Kent, M.L., Schreck, C.B., Occupancy modeling for improved accuracy and understanding of pathogen prevalence and dynamics (2015) PLoS ONE, 10. , https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0116605; Cooch, E.G., Conn, P.B., Ellner, S.P., Dobson, A.P., Pollock, K.H., Disease dynamics in wild populations: Modeling and estimation: A review (2012) Journal of Ornithology, 152, pp. S485-S509. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s10336-010-0636-3; Cross, P.C., Almberg, E.S., Haase, C.G., Hudson, P.J., Maloney, S.K., Metz, M.C., Munn, A.J., Smith, D.W., Energetic costs of mange in wolves estimated from infrared thermography (2016) Ecology, 97 (8), pp. 1938-1948. , https://doi.org/10.1890/15-1346.1; Denwood, M.J., runjags: An R package providing interface utilities, model templates, parallel computing methods and additional distributions for MCMC models in JAGS (2016) Journal of Statistical Software, 71 (9), pp. 1-25; Eads, D.A., Biggins, D.E., Doherty, P.F., Gage, K.L., Huyvaert, K.P., Long, D.H., Antolin, M.F., Using occupancy models to investigate the prevalence of ectoparasitic vectors on hosts: An example with fleas on prairie dogs (2013) International Journal for Parasitology: Parasites and Wildlife, 2, pp. 246-256. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijppaw.2013.09.002; Fidino, M., Barnas, G.R., Lehrer, E.W., Murray, M.H., Magle, S.B., The effect of lure on detecting mammals with camera traps (2020) Wildlife Society Bulletin, 44 (30), pp. 543-552; Fidino, M., Gallo, T., Lehrer, E.W., Murray, M.H., Kay, C., Sander, H.A., MacDougall, B., Magle, S.B., Landscape-scale differences among cities alter common species' responses to urbanization (2021) Ecological Applications, 31 (2); Fidino, M., Magle, S.B., Using Fourier series to estimate periodic patterns in dynamic occupancy models (2017) Ecosphere, 8 (9). , https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.1944; Fidino, M., Simonis, J.L., Magle, S.B., A multistate dynamic occupancy model to estimate local colonization–extinction rates and patterns of co-occurrence between two or more interacting species (2019) Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 10 (2), pp. 233-244. , https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13117; Gallo, T., Fidino, M., Lehrer, E.W., Magle, S.B., Mammal diversity and metacommunity dynamics in urban green spaces: Implications for urban wildlife conservation (2017) Ecological Applications, pp. 1-12. , https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.1611; Gallo, T., Fidino, M., Lehrer, E.W., Magle, S., Urbanization alters predator-avoidance behaviours (2019) Journal of Animal Ecology, 88 (5), pp. 793-803. , https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12967; Gehrt, S.D., Anchor, C., White, L.A., Home range and landscape use of coyotes in a metropolitan landscape: Conflict or coexistence?

Here, we introduce a method for the real-time analysis of the behaviour of mice housed in groups of up to four over several days and in enriched environments. The method combines computer vision through a depth-sensing infrared camera, machine learning for animal and posture identification, and radio-frequency identification to monitor the quality of mouse tracking. It tracks multiple mice accurately, extracts a list of behavioural traits of both individuals and the groups of mice, and provides a phenotypic profile for each animal. We used the method to study the impact of Shank2 and Shank3 gene mutations—mutations that are associated with autism—on mouse behaviour. Characterization and integration of data from the behavioural profiles of Shank2 and Shank3 mutant female mice revealed their distinctive activity levels and involvement in complex social interactions. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","","Cameras; Decision making; Machine learning; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Behavioural profiles; Enriched environments; Environmental factors; Infra-red cameras; Preclinical studies; Psychiatric disorders; Real time analysis; Social interactions; Mammals; animal behavior; animal experiment; animal model; Article; autism; body position; computer vision; controlled study; exploratory behavior; female; gene mutation; genotype; hyperactivity; hypoactivity; machine learning; male; mouse; nonhuman; radiofrequency identification; social interaction; social structure; animal; autism; behavioral research; disease model; genetics; knockout mouse; mutation; phenotype; psychology; social behavior; videorecording; nerve protein; Shank3 protein, mouse; Animals; Autistic Disorder; Behavior, Animal; Behavioral Research; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Machine Learning; Male; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Mutation; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Phenotype; Social Behavior; Video Recording","Tecott, L.H., Nestler, E.J., Neurobehavioral assessment in the information age (2004) Nat.

Recent improvements in wildlife cameras and ecological modelling have allowed for improved accuracy in estimates of abundance. In this study, we paired nest captures and high-definition nest video camera monitoring with modelling for a novel approach to estimate survival and abundance of threatened Piping Plovers Charadrius melodus breeding on Missouri River sandbars. From 2005 to 2014, we captured individuals on nests and uniquely marked them and recaptured previously marked individuals. In 2015–2017, we resighted marked individuals using small, high-definition video cameras deployed at nests, and counted the number of marked and unmarked breeding individuals associated with nests. We estimated apparent survival and derived estimates of the abundance of breeding individuals and population growth each year using a state-space Jolly–Seber superpopulation model with the addition of a binomial band ratio model for data collected using nest video cameras. Apparent survival averaged 0.73 ± 0.03 (mean ± sd) throughout the study. The number of breeding individuals varied, with the population increasing from 2012 to 2017 following a major habitat creation event. This study provides one of the few examples of camera data being used to produce demographic parameter and abundance estimates for an avian species. The camera and modelling methods described in this study may be applicable to other avian species in which some portion of the breeding population is uniquely marked. © 2019 British Ornithologists’ Union","conservation; high-definition nest cameras; methodology; Missouri River; shorebirds","breeding population; capture method; conservation management; methodology; nest; population estimation; survival; wader; Missouri River; United States; Aves; Charadrius melodus","Almalki, M., Shobrak, M., AlRashidi, M., dos Remedios, N., Székely, T., Sex differences and breeding ecology of a burrow-breeding shorebird, the Crab Plover Dromas ardeola (2014) Wader Study Group Bull., 121, pp. 169-176. , &; Andes, A.K., Shaffer, T.L., Sherfy, M.H., Hofer, C.M., Dovichin, C.M., Ellis-Felege, S.N., Accuracy of nest fate classification and predator identification from evidence at nests of Least Terns and Piping Plovers (2018) Ibis, 161, pp. 286-300. , &; Barker, R.J., Joint modeling of live-recapture, tag-resight, and tag-recovery data (1997) Biometrics, 53, pp. 666-677; Beaudrot, L., Ahumada, J.A., O'Brien, T., Alvarez-Loayza, P., Boekee, K., Campos-Arceiz, A., Eichberg, D., Andelman, S.J., Standardized assessment of biodiversity trends in tropical forest protected areas: the end is not in sight (2016) PLoS Biol., 14. , &; Bolton, M., Butcher, N., Sharpe, F., Stevens, D., Fisher, G., Remote monitoring of nests using digital camera technology (2007) J.

Multiple theories have been advanced and various models developed to account for the environment, interactions among species, and spatial drivers. However, relative importance comparisons of explanatory phenomena generally are neglected in these analyses. We developed a spatially explicit community occupancy model based on Markov random fields that accounts for spatial auto-correlation and interspecific interactions in occupancy while also accounting for interspecific interaction in detection. Simulations demonstrated that the model can distinguish different mechanisms of environmental sorting, such as competition and spatial-autocorrelation. We applied our model to camera trap data from a fisher (Pekania pennanti)–marten (Martes americana) and coyote (Canis latrans)-fox (Vulpes vulpes) system in Apostle Island National Lakeshore (Wisconsin, USA). Model results indicated that the observed partitioning pattern between marten and fisher distributions could be explained best by a flipped mainland–island source–sink pattern rather than by competition. For the coyote–fox system, we determined that, in addition to a mainland–island source–sink pattern, there was a positive association between fox and coyote that deserved further study. Our model could be readily applied to other landscapes (island and non-island systems), enhancing our understanding of species coexistence patterns. © 2021","Coyote–red fox; Fisher-marten; Markov Random Field; Occupancy model; Species coexistence","Coyote–red fox; Fisher-marten; Interspecific interactions; Markov Random Field model; Markov Random Fields; Occupancy model; Source-sink; Spatially explicit; Spatially explicit modeling; Species coexistence; Markov processes; canid; carnivore; coexistence; community dynamics; ecological modeling; interspecific interaction; Markov chain; numerical model; spatial analysis; Apostle Islands; Apostle Islands National Lakeshore; United States; Wisconsin; Canis latrans; Martes; Martes americana; Vulpes; Vulpes vulpes","Ables, E.D., Home-range studies of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) (1969) J.

Many attempts have been made to avoid these accidents, but few have been succeeded. One of the options is to use thermal images to identify the presence of deer. In this approach, large amount of image data have to be processed. This process will take long time and make the system incapable of real-time deer identification and tracking. Based on the well-known pattern recognition methods - histogram of orientated gradient (HOG) method and support vector machine method (SVM), this research developed a contour based HOG + SVM method, called CNT-HOG method. Experimental results showed that this algorithm has the advantages of both high accuracy (up to 95%) and less consumed time (0.1s) than traditional HOG+SVM method. Further analysis has been carried out to evaluate the influence of body postures and body blockages. By achieving this speed and accuracy, deer can be tracked in real-time. Accurate tracking and identification can then be achieved to reduce the possibility of deer - vehicle crashes.","Contour; Deer-vehicle crashes; HOG; Thermal imaging","Accurate tracking; Body postures; Car accidents; Contour; Deer-vehicle crashes; HOG; Image data; Pattern recognition method; Safety issues; Support vector machine method; Thermal images; Traffic safety; Vehicle crashes; Automobile bodies; Computer vision; Infrared imaging; Support vector machines; Accidents","Seamans, T.W., David, H.A., Evaluation of an electrified mat as a white-tailed deer (odocoileus virginianus) barrier (2008) International Journal of Pest Management, 54 (1), pp. 89-94; Stein, L., Oh, Deer!

It also provides stability to different natural processes of nature. In recent year, there are many animals which are facing the danger of extinction. The reason for animal extinction is natural occurrences such as climatic heating, cooling, or changes in sea levels. In literate, many techniques are proposed to detect and classify animals, but each technique has a limitation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework using deep convolutional neural networks (D-CNN) and k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) to detect animals. The dataset contains four class snow leopard, Marco polo sheep, Himalayan bear, and other animals. Many D-CNN like AlexNet, ResNet-50, VGG-19, and inception v3 are used to extract features. The experimental results verify that inception v3 integrated with kNN outperforms other D-CNNs. It also has more accuracy of 98.3% with a classification error of 2%, which is quite negligible. © 2020 IEEE.","Animal safety; D-CNN; Feature exctraction; Inception v3; KNN; Marco polo sheep detection;

However, this can be challenging for ecologically important solitary-foraging carnivores such as red foxes, which have flexible social systems. We used camera-traps to quantify seasonal changes in rates of territory intrusion by non-residents and compared group definitions based on shared space use (spatial overlap) and social encounters (spatiotemporal overlap). Group sizes based on spatial overlap were overestimated but incorporating a minimum number of sightings (sighting threshold) improved accuracy. Groups defined by spatiotemporal overlap were similar in size to those based on spatial overlap with a sighting threshold but included different individuals, highlighting the challenges of determining group membership. Groups were smallest in spring and summer and largest in autumn and winter because all definitions failed to exclude non-residents during the mating and dispersal seasons. However, non-residents were recorded year-round: over half were known or probable neighbours, and so may be relatives of territory residents. Strangers were most common in winter, when non-residents were more likely to be males in search of extra-group copulations. We conclude that groups of territorial, solitary foragers may be defined more accurately by combining patterns of space use, sighting frequency and social connectivity rather than considering these measures in isolation. When social information is not available, spatial overlap measures should include a sighting threshold. Surveying several adjacent territories concurrently helps identify the origins, and motivations, of non-resident visitors. © 2019 The Zoological Society of London","camera trapping; Canidae; group definition; group membership; seasonal changes; social encounters; territory intrusion; Vulpes vulpes","canid; digital photogrammetry; group behavior; group size; quantitative analysis; resident population; seasonality; social behavior; space use; territoriality; threshold; Canidae; Vulpes; Vulpes vulpes","Baker, P.J., Harris, S., The behavioural ecology of red foxes in urban Bristol (2004) Biology and conservation of wild canids, pp. 207-216. , &, Macdonald, D.W., &, Sillero-Zubiri, C., (Eds)., Oxford, Oxford University Press; Baker, P.J., Harris, S., Does culling reduce fox (Vulpes vulpes) density in commercial forests in Wales, UK?

However, predictive accuracy and power were largely impeded in a complex system including multiple environmental stressors and health outcome of which the occurrence might be episodic and irregular in time. In this study, we established four different deep learning (DL) models to capture inherent long-term dependencies in sequences and potential complex relationships among constituents by initiating with the original input into a representation at a higher abstract level. We collected 504,555 and 786,324 hospital outpatient visits of grouped categories of respiratory (RESD) and circulatory system disease (CCD), respectively, in Nanjing from 2013 through 2018. The matched observations in time-series that might pose risk to cardiopulmonary health involved conventional air pollutants concentrations and metrological conditions. The results showed that a well-trained network architecture built upon long short-term memory block and a working day enhancer achieved optimal performance by three quantitative statistics, i.e., 0.879 and 0.902 of Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, 0.921% and 0.667% of percent bias, and 0.347 and 0.312 of root mean square error-standard deviation ratio for RESD and CCD hospital visits, respectively. We observed the non-linear association of nitrogen dioxide and ambient air temperature with CCD hospital visits. Furthermore, these two environmental stressors were identified as the most sensitive predictive variables, and exerted synergetic effect for two health outcomes, particular in winter season. Our study indicated that high-quality surveillance data of atmospheric environments could provide novel opportunity for anticipating temporal trend of cardiopulmonary health outcomes based on DL model. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Cardiovascular; Deep learning; LSTM; Respiratory","Cardiovascular system; Complex networks; Efficiency; Error statistics; Health; Health risks; Hospitals; Mean square error; Network architecture; Nitrogen oxides; Ambient air temperature; Atmospheric environment; Cardiopulmonary disease; Complex relationships; Environmental stressors; Long-term dependencies; Predictive variables; Root mean square errors; Deep learning; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; nitrogen dioxide; air temperature; ambient air; cardiovascular system; concentration (composition); environmental stress; health risk; learning; nitrogen dioxide; numerical model; performance assessment; air pollutant; air temperature; ambient air; Article; cardiovascular disease; China; environmental exposure; human; long short term memory network; meteorology; nonlinear system; outpatient; particulate matter; quantitative analysis; respiratory tract disease; winter; air pollutant; air pollution; cardiovascular disease; incidence; season; China; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cardiovascular Diseases; China; Deep Learning; Humans; Incidence; Nitrogen Dioxide; Particulate Matter; Seasons","Allen-Sader, C., Thurston, W., Meyer, M., Nure, E., Bacha, N., Alemayehu, Y., Stutt, R., Gilligan, C.A., An early warning system to predict and mitigate wheat rust diseases in Ethiopia (2019) Environ.

Recent evidence from South Africa shows that cheetahs avoid dominant predators at scent-marking sites, which may delay or inhibit intraspecific communication in cheetahs. However, little is known on whether this pattern of avoidance occurs elsewhere in the cheetah's range. We analysed a 9-year camera trap data set from north-central Namibia to explore interspecific use of marking sites by cheetahs and leopards. We documented frequent sharing of marking sites, which was likely facilitated through temporal segregation and by availability of alternative sites that were species-specific. We did not identify a stronger avoidance response of cheetahs to leopards than to conspecifics, suggesting that delayed communication by cheetahs resulting from predator avoidance may be limited in our study area. Seasonality affected patterns of marking site visitation, which may be attributed to behavioural changes in relation to reproduction or resource availability, or to differential detectability of olfactory cues among seasons. We recommend further research to better understand carnivore scent-marking, including behavioural responses to olfactory cues and environmental conditions, as well as intra- and interpopulation differences. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Acinonyx jubatus; carnivore; competition; heterospecific; interspecific; olfactory; Panthera pardus; seasonality","carnivore; environmental conditions; felid; interspecific variation; olfaction; olfactory cue; predator; reproduction; scent marking; seasonality; spatiotemporal analysis; Namibia; Acinonyx jubatus; Namibia; Panthera pardus","Agostinelli, C., Lund, U., (2017), .

Due to their circumpolar distribution and the remoteness and vastness of their habitat, little is known about their population sizes. Estimating pack-ice seal population sizes and trends is key to understanding how the Southern Ocean ecosystem will react to threats such as climate change driven sea ice loss and krill fishing. We present a functional pack-ice seal detection pipeline using Worldview-3 imagery and a Convolutional Neural Network that counts and locates seal centroids. We propose a new CNN architecture that detects objects by combining semantic segmentation heatmaps with binary classification and counting by regression. Our pipeline locates over 30% of seals, when compared to consensus counts from human experts, and reduces the time required for seal detection by 95% (assuming just a single GPU). While larger training sets and continued algorithm development will no doubt improve classification accuracy, our pipeline, which can be easily adapted for other large-bodied animals visible in sub-meter satellite imagery, demonstrates the potential for machine learning to vastly expand our capacity for regular pack-ice seal surveys and, in doing so, will contribute to ongoing international efforts to monitor pack-ice seals. © 2019","APIS; CCAMLR; Crabeater seal; Deep learning; Leptonychotes weddellii; Lobodon carcinophaga; Object detection; Segmentation; Very high resolution; Weddell seal","Classification (of information); Climate change; Deep learning; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; Machine learning; Mammals; Neural networks; Object detection; Population statistics; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Semantics; APIS; CCAMLR; Leptonychotes weddellii; Lobodon carcinophaga; Very high resolution; Weddell seals; Pipelines; algorithm; climate change; image resolution; learning; pinniped; pipeline; satellite imagery; sea ice; segmentation; snowpack; WorldView; Southern Ocean; Weddell Sea; Animalia; Euphausia superba; Euphausiacea; Leptonychotes weddellii; Lobodon carcinophaga; Lobodon carcinophagus; Phocidae","Ackley, S., Bengtson, J., Bester, M., Blix, A., Bornemann, H., Boveng, P., Boyd, I., Yochem, P., The International Antarctic Pack Ice Seals (APIS) Program.

Forest fragmentation and habitat loss have been shown to affect seed predation, leading to altered tree recruitment. However, the effects of fragmentation and habitat loss on seed predation are highly variable and context-specific, with limited information from South Asia. For four rainforest tree species in a production landscape of tea and coffee, we examined the influence of forest type (benchmark, N = 3, and fragmented, N = 5, forests) and seed size on the proportion of seeds, 1) predated by vertebrate seed predators, 2) predated by invertebrate seed predators, and 3) removed by vertebrate seed predators. The seed fates were tracked by placing the seeds in four 1 × 1 m plots under the canopy of the tree (N ≥ 11 individuals per tree species and 48 trees overall), and camera traps were placed under a subset of trees (N = 29, trap-nights = 712). Overall, we recorded nine species of seed predators, and that the seed predator species composition differed among the four tree species. However, there was no significant difference in either seed predator species composition or their visitations across the forest types. The seeds were more likely to be predated (on average 6% higher predation) by vertebrate seed predators in the fragments than in the benchmark forests. Medium-seeded species were more likely to be predated by vertebrate seed predators than large-seeded species (on average 41% higher predation). Invertebrate seed predation and seed removal by vertebrate seed predators had a weak relationship with forest type, with higher invertebrate seed predation in the fragments and higher seed removal in the benchmark forests. With altered seed dispersal patterns resulting from habitat fragmentation and habitat loss, differential seed predation can alter regeneration patterns, thereby influencing adult tree communities in fragmented forests. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS","Fragmentation; Rainforest; Seed predation; Seed size; Western Ghats","coffee; habitat fragmentation; habitat loss; plant community; rainforest; seed dispersal; seed dormancy; seed predation; Viet Nam; Invertebrata; Vertebrata","Aliyu, B., Adamu, H., Moltchanova, E., Forget, P.M., Chapman, H., The interplay of habitat and seed type on scatter hoarding behavior in a fragmented Afromontane forest landscape (2014) Biotropica, 46 (3), pp. 264-267; Anand, M.O., Krishnaswamy, J., Kumar, A., Bali, A., Sustaining biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes in the Western Ghats: remnant forests matter (2010) Biol.

Classification models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proved successful in annotating images, but few applications have extended these to video classification. We demonstrate an approach that combines a standard CNN summarizing each video frame with a recurrent neural network (RNN) that models the temporal component of video. The approach is illustrated using two datasets: one collected by static video cameras detecting seal activity inside coastal salmon nets and another collected by animal-borne cameras deployed on African penguins, used to classify behavior. The combined RNN-CNN led to a relative improvement in test set classification accuracy over an image-only model of 25% for penguins (80% to 85%), and substantially improved classification precision or recall for four of six behavior classes (12–17%). Image-only and video models classified seal activity with very similar accuracy (88 and 89%), and no seal visits were missed entirely by either model. Temporal patterns related to movement provide valuable information about animal behavior, and classifiers benefit from including these explicitly. We recommend the inclusion of temporal information whenever manual inspection suggests that movement is predictive of class membership. © 2021 The Authors.","animal-borne video; automated detection; deep learning;

In addition, habitat use of this species at three sites with different land use regime (Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve, community reserves, and anthropic sites) in the Lacandon Rainforest, Chiapas, Mexico was analysed. From the perspective of the source-sink systems, it was predicted that pacas selectively would use the habitat with higher food and cavity availability (source habitats), where higher densities were expected. Twelve transects were located in three sites with different land use regimes, where food availability and potential cavities used by pacas were assessed. Along these transects, 4 camera-traps were deployed every 200 meters to estimate the relative abundance of pacas and their potential competitors and predators. Photo-captured individuals were identified to estimate population density and seasonal variation in habitat use. Generalized linear models (GLM) were constructed to analyse the effects of several variables on paca abundance and density. A relative abundance of 0.05 and 0.08 paca photographs/100 camera-days were recorded in the dry and the rainy season, respectively. A density of 54 pacas/km2 was estimated in both seasons. The availability of cavities was the only variable that showed a significant effect on paca density (P = 0.04 for the dry season, and P = 0.006 for the rainy season). Community reserves were used in the dry season more than expected from their availability in the study area (x2 = 28.8; P = 0.0001). In the rainy season, all three sites were used by paca in proportion to their availability. Our results suggest that the cavities used as refuges by pacas drive their population dynamics, and constitute a key habitat resource for them in the study area. We propose that the Ejidal Reserve and Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve may be source habitats supporting higher paca densities and greater availability of adequate cavities to protect adults and their offspring. On the other hand, areas transformed into croplands and grasslands for livestock production would represent sink habitats with lower paca densities, less availability of adequate cavities, and absence of offspring. The long-term conservation and habitat management of pacas in transformed landscapes will probably rely on the distribution and connectivity between and within the different habitat types available in the study area. © 2017 Asociación Mexicana de Mastozoología.","Cavities; Food; Hunting pressure; Rodent; Source-sink","","Ahumada, J.A., Hurtado, J., Lizcano, D., Monitoring the status and trends of tropical forest terrestrial vertebrate communities from camera trap data: A tool for conservation (2013) PLoS ONE, 8, p. e73707; Aquino, R., Gil, D., Pezo, E., Aspectos ecológicos y sostenibilidad de la caza del majá (Cuniculus paca) en la cuenca del río Itaya, Amazonía peruana (2009) Revista Peruana de Biología, 16, pp. 67-72; Aquino, R., Meléndez, G., Pezo, E., Gil, D., Tipos y formas de ambientes de dormir de majás (Cuniculus paca) en la cuenca alta del río Itaya (2012) Revista Peruana de Biología, 19, pp. 27-34; Aranda-Sánchez, J.M., (2012) Manual para el Rastreo de Mamíferos Silvestres de México.

These periods usually occur in or close to night time and last just a few hours, so automated sampling devices are needed to characterize them. However, the commercially available automated models do not provide enough temporal resolution for characterizing the short diel periods of sexual activity of moths. Thus, we built and tested a relatively cheap and simple high-temporal-resolution image-sensor insect trap. It consisted of a Raspberry Pi computer with an infrared camera operated by open-source software and housed in a plastic box. The Raspberry Pi was powered by a solar panel and rechargeable battery that were mounted on a solid and weather-proof structure made of cheap materials. Pictures were downloaded by WiFi from the Raspberry’s SD card to a computer. Six traps baited either with synthetic sex pheromone or with females of Grapholita molesta (Busk) were tested in the field. The traps were sturdy, reliable and easy to use, taking pictures at 10 min intervals, 24 h a day for over two months. These pictures confirmed previous results regarding the period of sexual activity of the oriental fruit moth, which will aid in determining the optimal time for operating automated pheromone dispensers. © 2021.

Camera-trapping and spoor counts can provide reliable population estimates for many carnivores, but governments typically lack the resources to implement such surveys over the spatial scales required to inform robust quota setting. It may therefore be prudent to shift focus away from estimating population size and instead focus on monitoring population trend. In this paper we assess the susceptibility of African leopards Panthera pardus to trophy hunting. This has management ramifications, particularly if the use of harvest composition is to be explored as a metric of population trend. We explore the susceptibility of different leopard age and sex cohorts to trophy hunting; first by examining their intrinsic susceptibility to encountering trophy hunters using camera-traps as surrogates, and second by assessing their extrinsic susceptibility using photographic questionnaire surveys to determine their attractiveness to hunters. We show that adult male and female leopards share similar incident rates to encountering hunters but adult males are the most susceptible to hunting due to hunter preference for large trophies. In contrast, sub-adult leopards rarely encounter hunters and are the least attractive trophies. We suggest that our findings be used as a foundation for the exploration of a harvest composition scheme in the Kwazulu-Natal and Limpopo provinces where post mortem information is collected from hunted leopards and submitted to the local provincial authorities. © 2015 Braczkowski et al.","","adult; animal behavior; animal hunting; Article; Botswana; female; human; leopard; male; Namibia; nonhuman; questionnaire; risk; sex difference; South Africa; Tanzania; telemetry; trophy hunting; Zambia; Zimbabwe; animal; environmental protection; Panthera; Panthera pardus; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Humans; Panthera; South Africa","Lindsey, P.A., Roulet, P.A., Romañach, S.S., Economic and conservation significance of the trophy hunting industry in sub-Saharan Africa (2007) Biol Cons, 134, pp. 455-469; Loveridge, A.J., Searle, A.W., Murindagomo, F., Macdonald, D.W., The impact of sport-hunting on the population dynamics of an African lion population in a protected area (2007) Biol Cons, 134, pp. 548-558; Crosmary, W.G., Loveridge, A.J., Ndaimani, H., Lebel, S., Booth, V., Côté, S.D., Trophy hunting in Africa: Long-term trends in antelope horn size (2013) Anim Conserv, 16, pp. 648-660; Whitman, K., Starfield, A.M., Quadling, H.S., Packer, C., Sustainable trophy hunting of African lions (2004) Nature, 428, pp. 175-178. , PMID: 14990967; Leader-Williams, N., Smith, R.J., Walpole, M.J., Elephant hunting and conservation (2001) Science, 293, pp. 2203-2204. , PMID: 11569496; Milner-Gulland, E.J., Bukreeva, O.M., Coulson, T., Lushchekina, A.A., Kholodova, M.V., Bekenov, A.B., Reproductive collapse in a harem-breeding ungulate (2003) Nature, 422, p. 135. , PMID: 12634775; Coltman, D.W., O'Donoghue, P., Jorgenson, J.T., Hogg, J.T., Strobeck, C., Festa-Bianchet, M., Undesirable evolutionary consequences of trophy hunting (2003) Nature, 426, pp. 655-658. , PMID: 14668862; Packer, C., Kosmala, M., Cooley, H.S., Brink, H., Pintea, L., Garshelis, D., Sport hunting, predator control and conservation of large carnivores (2009) PLOS ONE, 4, pp. 1-8; Clark, T., Rutherford, M., Casey, D., (2005) Coexisting with Large Carnivores: Lessons from Greater Yellowstone, , New York: Island Press; Anderson, C.R., Lindzey, F.G., Experimental evaluation of population trend and harvest composition in a Wyoming cougar population (2005) Wildlife Soc B, 33, pp. 179-188; Lee, J., Taylor, M., Aspects of the Polar Bear Harvest in the Northwest Territories, Canada (1994) Bears: Their Biology and Management, 9, pp. 237-243; Barnhurst, D., (1986) Vulnerability of Cougars to Hunting, , M.S thesis.

Farmagudi, Ponda, Goa, India","Normally camera traps are the typical devices that are used in the field for the study of wildlife species in deep and remote forests but here using the basic idea of camera trapping, we are trying to reduce the damage or the man animal conflict, that is coming up these days, everywhere on a massive scale, that is we are using the principles of bioacoustics and image processing, in order to reduce the problems or damages caused by wild animals to the farmers, hence considering this fact that since humans, day by day have encroached into the forest and thereby since there is a reduction in green cover which in turn reflects in the migration and transit pattern of animals thereby animals land up in human habitation. Hence we make use of high frequency and high intensity sound waves to drive away the animals, which cause harm or loss. Along with the concept of image processing so as to identify the particular animal and emit those particular frequencies which are most sensitive to that particular animal and hence thereby these frequencies cause a neurophysiologic effect such that a particular animal will get affected and go away from the site where it is causing damage. As the name Bioacoustics itself means biology and acoustics i.e. it's a cross-disciplinary science that combines biology and acoustics. Since sound is an important component that is used in communication, hence every sound or call in animals or human beings is having certain significance. Suppose like for example in birds, the early morning calls are to mark the territory, that is each bird marks a territory within that area, it is specified that a certain bird is living in a certain area and a bird of similar species cannot enter its territory. Similarly some birds can imitate calls of other birds, these calls are emitted with a motive of food competition. Similarly we are trying to make use of sound waves but here it's not just sound waves that we make directly use of but instead we use the parameters of sound that is frequency and intensity. Now since each animal is having its own auditory field hence the hearing range of each animal would be different so the frequency that is emitted, would be specific for every animal hence, therefore it is necessary to identify each animal. Now Identification of the animal would be carried out, such that camera would be placed in the path where the animal would come. Once image is clicked by camera it would be processed and further, it would identify a particular animal and hence would ease the task of emitting that particular band of frequencies which are most sensitive to that particular animal. © 2017 IEEE.","Animal repeller; Automatic identification; Camera trap; Frequency generation; Image processing","Acoustics; Audition; Automation; Bioacoustics; Birds; Cameras; Digital storage; Forestry; Soft computing; Automatic identification; Cross-disciplinary; Frequency generation; High frequency HF; High intensity; Human habitation; Wild animals; Wildlife species; Image processing","Basichumanearfunctioningand, , http://www.dspguide.com/ch22/1.htm; Bioqcousticsanditsprinciples, , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioacoustics; HearingRangeofdifferentanimals, , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearingrange; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equalloudnesscontour; Gildorf, J.M., Hygnstrom, S.E., VerCauteren, K.C., Clements, G.M., Blankenship, E.E., Engeman, R.M., Evaluation of a deer-activated bioacoustic frightening device for reducing deer damage in cornfields (2004) USDA National Wildlife; Asif, A.G., Joost, X.M., Rhesus Monkeys (Macaca Mulatta) Hear Rising Frequency Sounds As Looming, 123 (4), pp. 822-827. , (Duke University), Behavioral Neuroscience ©2009 American Psychological Association2009 0735-7044/09/$12.00; Op-Amps and Linear Integrated Circuits, , by Ramakant A.

However, these traits can also attract seed predators. These selection pressures stimulate the generation of strategies to attract more dispersers than predators. Here, we describe a strategy used by the Astrocaryum malybo palm to avoid predation of unripe fruits using prickles as a structural defense. We use camera traps to monitor three individuals of the palm for five months. We analyzed 83 videos of two animal species interacting with the palms fruits (Central American Agouti, Dasyprocta punctata and Red-tailed Squirrel, Notosciurus granatensis). Of these, six correspond to an individual with unprotected unripe fruits and 77 to an individual with exposed ripe fruits. No interaction was recorded in the individual with protected unripe fruits. We suggest that A. malybo has developed these prickles as a structural defense strategy to protect its unripe fruits from vertebrate predators. We use camera traps that allow documentation of basic natural history information including such otherwise cryptic interactions. This type of information can be used in models of food web structure, revealing unknown details of the ecological and evolutionary processes of such species interactions. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Frugivory; Palm; Seed predation; Trap camera; Tropical dry forest","","Ballesteros, J., Linares, J.C., (2015) Fauna de Cordoba, Colombia.

Increased demand from China has resulted in pangolins being the most trafficked mammal in the world. Three pangolin species are reported to occur in Bangladesh: Manis pentadactyla, M. crassicaudata, and M. javanica. No peer-reviewed studies exist detailing these species' current distribution or status within Bangladesh. A literature review was conducted resulting in the clarification of conflicting reports and misidentified observations and specimen records. In this paper, we also report the current status of pangolins (Manis spp.) in Bangladesh based on semi-structured interviews, camera trapping, media queries, and field surveys employing traditional ecological knowledge and non-randomized transect surveys. Ethnozoological knowledge pertaining to the natural history of M. pentadactyla is also reported from experienced Mro tribal hunters. The critically endangered M. pentadactyla was verified to occur in northwest, northeast, and southeast Bangladesh in natural and degraded habitats. Interviews with the Mro tribe in the southeast indicate that pangolin populations there were likely extirpated in 2014 due to skilled commercial collection beginning in 2010. Evidence of extant M. crassicaudata and M. javanica populations remain unverified and questionable, and historical records of M. crassicaudata and M. javanica are likely a result of misidentification. © 2017 Trageser et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.","","Bangladesh; field study; habitat; history; information processing; nonhuman; Pholidota; semi structured interview; species; animal; Bangladesh; environmental protection; mammal; Animals; Bangladesh; Conservation of Natural Resources; Mammals","Challender, D., Baillie, J., Ades, G., Kaspal, P., Chan, B., Khatiwada, A., (2014) Manis Pentadactyla, , The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species; Challender, D., Nguyen, T., Shepherd, C., Krishnasamy, K., Wang, A., Lee, B., (2014) Manis Javanica, , The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species; Baillie, J., Challender, D., Kaspal, P., Khatiwada, A., Mohapatra, R., Nash, H., (2014) Manis Crassicaudata, , The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species; Reza, A.H.M., (2010) Diversity of Amphibians and Reptiles in Bangladesh: Impact of Climate Change, Biogeography, and Conservation Management of Herpetofauna in Bangladesh, , Saarbrücken, Germany: Lap Lambert Academic Publishing; Choudrury, A., On the pangolin and porcupine species of Bangladesh (2004) Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society, 101 (3), pp. 444-445; Zhou, Z., Zhou, Y., Newman, C., Macdonald, D., Scaling up pangolin protection in China (2014) Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 12, pp. 97-98; Khan, M.M.H., (2008) Protected Areas of Bangladesh - A Guide to Wildlife, , Dhaka, Bangladesh: Nishorgo Program, Bangladesh Forest Department; Khan, M.A.R., (1985) Mammals of Bangladesh: A Field Guide, , Dhaka, Bangladesh: Nazma Reza; Khan, M.A.R., (2010) Wildlife of Bangladesh from Amphibia to Mammalia - A Checklist, , Dhaka, Bangladesh: Shahitya Prakash; Lagrada, L., Schoppe, S., Challender, D., (2014) Manis Culionensis, , The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species; (1986) Bangladesh CITES MA, , In litt. to IUCN Conservation Monitoring Centre. 1986; Agrawal, V., Das, P., Chakraborty, S., Ghose, R., Mandal, A., Chakraborty, T., (1992) Mammalian: Fauna of West Bengal, State Fauna Series 3, , Calcutta, India: Zoological Survey of India; (2003) Bangladesher Bipanno Bonno Prani (Threatened Wild Animals of Bangladesh), , IUCN Bangladesh Dhaka, Bangladesh: IUCN-The World Conservation Union; Ahmed, Z.U., Begum, Z.N.T., Hassan, M.A., Khondker, M., Kabir, S.M.H., Ahmad, M., (2009) Encyclopedia of Flora and Fauna of Bangladesh, Volume 27: Mammals, , Dhaka, Bangladesh: Asiatic Society of Bangladesh; Ahsan, M.F., Chowdhury, M.A., Mammals of the Chittagong University campus, Chittagong (2008) Bangladesh: J.

Herein we describe xenathran communities across the Brazilian Cerrado and study the effects of habitat fragmentation on occupancy and activity patterns on these assemblages. Our hypothesis was that larger and specialized species would be more ecologically sensitive, and likely to exhibit shifts in their activity patterns in more deforested areas as a way of dealing with the myriad of effects involved in the fragmentation process. The study was conducted by camera trapping in ten Cerrado sites. Five species were analyzed: Priodontes maximus, Euphractus sexcinctus, Dasypus novemcintus (Order Cingulata), Tamandua tetradactyla and Myrmecophaga tridactyla (Order Pilosa). Fragmentation was quantified by landscape metrics, calculated on scales that matched the species' home ranges. Occupancy and detection probability analyses were conducted to test for shifts in occupancy under different fragmentation conditions. A mixed-effects model analysis was conducted to test for shifts in species' frequency of records related to time of day, controlling for spatial autocorrelation by means of eigenvector-based spatial filters for the models' residuals. There were no changes in activity pattern between more and less fragmented areas, so that our behavioural plasticity hypothesis was not corroborated for this group. The lack of changes in the patterns could be explained by a species' time-lag response, or by the lack of a wide enough fragmentation gradient in our study. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Activity pattern; Ecological sensitivity; Habitat fragmentation; Landscape ecology; Xenarthra","activity pattern; community structure; conservation management; deforestation; habitat conservation; habitat fragmentation; landscape; mammal; phenotypic plasticity; specialization; Brazil; Cingulata; Dasypus; Euphractus sexcinctus; Mammalia; Myrmecophaga tridactyla; Priodontes maximus; Tamandua tetradactyla; Xenarthra","Ab'Saber, A.N., O domínio dos Cerrados: Introdução ao conhecimento (1983) Rev Serv Púb, 111, pp. 41-55; Anacleto, T.C.S., Food Habits of Four Armadillo Species in the Cerrado Area, Mato Grosso, Brazil (2007) Zool Stud, 46, pp. 529-537; Anacleto, T.C.S., Marinho-Filho, J., Hábito alimentar do tatu canastra (Xenarthra, Dasypodidae) em uma área de Cerrado do Brasil Central (2001) Rev Bras Zool, 18, pp. 681-688; Andrén, H., Effects of habitat fragmentation on birds and mammals in landscapes with different proportions of suitable habitat: a review (1994) Oikos, 71, pp. 355-366; Bennington, C.C., Thayne, W.V., Use and misuse of mixed model analysis of variance in ecological studies (1994) Ecology, 75, pp. 717-722; Beyer, H.L., (2004) Hawth's analysis tools for ArcGIS, , http://www.spatialecology.com/htools, Accessed February 2010; Bierregaard Jr., R.O., Laurance, W.F., Sites, J.W., Key priorities for the study of fragmented tropical ecosystems (1997) Tropical Forest Remnants: Ecology, Management and Conservation of Fragmented Communities, pp. 515-525. , W.

It is very important step for doctors to help the patients who suffered by snakes bites. Hence here a study was done on processing images to classify them as different family of snakes using CNN (Convolution Neural Network) model in Deep Learning techniques. The CNN model needs different snakes and their bite marks images to classify them as venomous and non-venomous snakes and by processing venomous snakes bite marks images it can able to find the venomous snakes family. To give accurate results the proposed Deep learning model has to be trained periodically with all possible different images of same snake's family and different snakes' families. The performance of the CNN model is on its knowledge and finding patterns on the input images to find the family of the snakes.

While non-invasive DNA sampling strategies could serve this task, genetic samples of lynx are generally hard to locate. To test the suitability of dog-based sampling we searched scat samples of lynx in the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany, with two trained detection dog teams. In 44 grid cells of 2 × 2 km, dog teams covered 440 km of predetermined forest road and hiking trail transects during the four week survey. A total of 169 collected samples resulted in 52 genetically confirmed lynx detections, of which 26 were assigned to 11 individuals. Using a single-season site occupancy model we found a detection probability of 0.13/km (SD = 0.02), with 10 km of dog search per grid cell required to get a 70 % probability to detect lynx presence. Our results show that detection dogs are an appropriate tool for systematic genetic lynx monitoring. We argue that detection dog-assisted genetic monitoring may supplement monitoring strategies based on conventional camera trapping, especially when aiming to monitor genetic diversity and population connectivity. © 2018 Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde","Bavarian Forest National Park; Detection dog; Lynx lynx; Non-invasive DNA sampling; Scat","biomonitoring; canid; connectivity; detection method; DNA; feces; felid; forest; genetic structure; population distribution; population dynamics; population estimation; population growth; sampling; species conservation; species occurrence; transect; Bavaria; Bavarian Forest National Park; Germany; Canis familiaris; Lynx; Lynx lynx","Alda, F., Inogés, J., Alcaraz, L., Oria, J., Aranda, A., Doadrio, I., Looking for the Iberian lynx in central Spain: a needle in a haystack?

We investigated how medium- to large-bodied mammals respond to factors at local (habitat type), intermediate (land use heterogeneity, forest cover and human population density) and large spatial scales (overall forest cover) in agroforestry landscapes. We surveyed mammals using camera traps in traditional cacao agroforests (cabrucas), intensified cacao agroforests, and forest remnants within two large Atlantic Forest landscapes of southern Bahia, Brazil, representing both high and low forest cover. At the local scale, habitat types differed in their potential to harbour mammal species, with forest remnants and cabrucas showing high conservation value, mainly under contexts of high forest cover, whereas intensified cacao agroforests contained less diversified species assemblages in both landscapes. At intermediate scales, species richness increased with increasing forest cover around forest remnants and intensified cacao agroforests, but the opposite was observed in cabrucas. The effects of human population density were ubiquitous but species-dependent. At the largest scale, species richness was higher in the most forested landscape, highlighting the imperative of maintaining forest remnants to retain forest-dwelling mammals in human-dominated landscapes. We claim that mammal conservation strategies require a multi-scale approach and that no single strategy is likely to maximize persistence of all species. Some species can routinely use traditional agroforests, and a large fraction of mammal diversity can be maintained even if high canopy-cover agroforestry dominates the landscape. Nevertheless, forest patches and highly forested landscapes are essential to ensure the persistence of forest-dwelling and game species. © 2020, The Author(s).","Agriculture; Agroecosystem; Forest cover; Habitat type; Heterogeneity; Human density","agroforestry; biodiversity; conservation management; conservation planning; forest cover; forest ecosystem; human activity; landscape ecology; mammal; plantation; population density; shade tolerance; species richness; strategic approach; tropical forest; Atlantic Forest; Bahia; Brazil; Mammalia","Anand, M.O., Krishnaswamy, J., Kumar, A., Bali, A., Sustaining biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes in the Western Ghats: remnant forests matter (2010) Biol Conserv, 143, pp. 2363-2374; Anderson, M.J., (2017) Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA), , https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118445112.stat07841, Wiley StatsRef Stat Ref Online 1–15; Beca, G., Vancine, M.H., Carvalho, C.S., High mammal species turnover in forest patches immersed in biofuel plantations (2017) Biol Conserv, 210, pp. 352-359; Benchimol, M., Peres, C.A., Predicting local extinctions of Amazonian vertebrates in forest islands created by a mega dam (2015) Biol Conserv, 187, pp. 61-72; Benton, T.G., Vickery, J.A., Wilson, J.D., Farmland biodiversity: is habitat heterogeneity the key?

The method uses a Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet) to extract special keypoints of an image of the ventral surface of the fluke and then a separate DenseNet trained to look for features within these keypoints. The extracted features are then compared against those of the reference set of previously known humpback whales for similarity. This offers the potential to successfully automate recognition of individuals in large photographic datasets such as in ocean basin-wide marine mammal studies. The algorithm requires minimal image pre-processing and is capable of accurate, rapid matching of fair to high-quality humpback fluke photographs. In real world testing compared to manual image matching, the algorithm reduces image management time by at least 98% and reduces error rates of missing potential matches from approximately 6–9% to 1–3%. The success of this new system permits automated comparisons to be made for the first time across photo-identification datasets with tens to hundreds of thousands of individually identified encounters, with profound implications for long-term and large population studies of the species. © 2021, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde.","Automated image recognition; Computer vision; Deep convolutional neural networks; Kaggle competition; Machine learning; Mark recapture; Megaptera novaeangliae; Photo-ID","","Report of the Workshop on Southern Hemisphere blue, fin and humpback whale photo-identification catalogues from the Central and Eastern South Pacific and the Antarctic Peninsula (2017) Rep Int Whal Commun; Arzoumanian, Z., Holmberg, J., Norman, B., An astronomical pattern-matching algorithm for computer-aided identification of whale sharks Rhincodon typus (2005) J Appl Ecol, 42, pp. 999-1011; Barlow, J., Calambokidis, J., Falcone, E.A., Baker, C.S., Burdin, A.M., Clapham, P.J., Ford, J.K.B., Yamaguchi, M., Humpback whale abundance in the North Pacific estimated by photographic capture-recapture with bias correction from simulation studies (2011) Mar Mamm Sci, 27, pp. 793-818; Status review of the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) under the endangered species act (2015) NOAA-TM-NMFS-SWFSC-, 540, p. 240. , National Marine Fisheries Service, Silver Spring, MD; Blackmer, A.L., Anderson, S.K., Weinrich, M.T., Temporal variability in features used to photo-identify humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) (2000) Mar Mamm Sci, 16, pp. 338-354; Bogucki, R., Cygan, M., Khan, C.B., Klimek, M., Milczek, J.K., Mucha, M., Applying deep learning to right whale photo identification (2019) Conserv Biol, 33, pp. 676-684; Calambokidis, J., Falcone, E.A., Quinn, T.J., Burdin, A.M., Clapham, P.J., Ford, J.K.B., Gabriele, C.M., Brachostraley, L.-J.M., (2008); Clapham, M., Miller, E., Nguyen, M., van Horn, R.C., Multispecies facial detection for individual identification of wildlife: A case study across ursids (2022) Mamm Biol (Special Issue), 102. , in press; Clutton-Brock, T.H., Sheldon, B.C., Individuals and populations: the role of long-term, individual-based studies of animals in ecology and evolutionary biology (2010) Trends Ecol Evol, 25, pp. 562-573; Crall, J.P., Stewart, C.V., Berger-Wolf, T.Y., Rubenstein, D.I., Sundaresan, S.R., HotSpotter—patterned species instance recognition (2013) 2013 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), pp. 230-237; Deng, J., Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L., Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database (2009) 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Deng, J., Guo, J., Xue, N., Zafeiriou, S., ArcFace: Additive Angular Margin Loss for Deep Face Recognition (2018) Proc IEEE Comput Soc Conf Comput Vis Pattern Recognit 2019-June, pp. 4685-4694; Fleming, A., Jackson, J., Global review of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) (2011) NOAA Technical Memorandum.

If the occupancy quantity in a pre-determined thermal zone is aware, a building automation system (BAS) is able to intelligently adjust the building operation to provide “just-enough” heating, cooling, and ventilation capacities to building users. Therefore, an occupancy counting device that can be widely deployed at low prices with low failure rate, small form-factor, good usability, and conserved user privacy is highly desirable. Existing occupancy detection or recognition sensors (e.g., passive infrared, camera, acoustic, RFID, CO2) cannot meet all these above system requirements. In this work, we present an IoT (Internet of Things) prototype that collects room occupancy information to assist in the operation of energy-efficient buildings. The proposed IoT prototype consists of Lattice iCE40-HX1K stick FPGA boards and Raspberry Pi modules. Two pairs of our prototypes are installed at a door frame. When a person walks through this door frame, blocking of active infrared streams between both pairs of IoT prototypes is detected. The direction of human movement is obtained through comparing occurrence time instances of two obstructive events. Thus, the change in occupancy quantity of a thermal zone is calculated and updated. Besides, an open-source application user interface is developed to allow anonymous users or building automation systems to easily acquire room occupancy information. We carry out a three-month random test of human entry and exit of a thermal zone, and find that the occupancy counting accuracy is 97%. The proposed design is completely made of off-the-shelf electronic components and the estimated cost is less than $160. To investigate the impact on building energy savings, we conduct a building energy simulation using EnergyPlus and find the payback period is approximately 4 months. In summary, the proposed design is miniature, non-intrusive, ease of use, low failure rate, and cost-effective for smart buildings.

Observer-independent methods such as camera trapping facilitate the study of interactions, but analyses are hampered by the lack of comparative assessment of available approaches. We present a flexible and expandable framework to simulate and explore spatiotemporal interactions between species from camera trapping data with well-defined properties, and compare methods to detect such interactions in a two-species system with two types of (spatio)temporal interactions: spatiotemporal avoidance (of a site by a species after the presence of another species) and temporal segregation (shifts in daily activity patterns between species), across a range of daily activity patterns and interaction strengths. For spatiotemporal avoidance, we analysed time intervals between species records using linear models, the Mann–Whitney U-test, a permutation test and a test based on randomly generated records. For temporal segregation, we applied a permutation test. Statistical power (the ability to detect an existing effect) for detecting spatiotemporal avoidance between species was strongly affected by interaction strength, highest for linear models and reliable above 50 records per species. Reliably detecting strong temporal segregation required fewer records (10–20 records) but depended heavily on the underlying activity pattern. All tests were valid (uniform distribution of P-values under the null hypothesis) even at low sample sizes above a minimum of 10 records per species. Linear models were the most suitable approach to analyse spatiotemporal avoidance and can easily correct for other sources of variation in interactions. The framework presented here can help to improve survey design in camera trapping and be extended to more complex settings (e.g. with imperfect detection). In addition, it allows researchers to validate the methods used for inference of spatiotemporal interactions from camera trapping data in their specific circumstances. © 2019 The Authors Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Zoological Society of London","Avoidance; behavioural response; circadian activity; competition; predator–mesopredator relationship; predator–prey relationship","","Adams, D.C., Anthony, C.D., Using randomization techniques to analyze behavioural data (1996) Anim.

Considerable efforts have been put on panda conservation and reproduction, offering the promising outcome of maintaining the population size of pandas. To evaluate the effectiveness of conservation and management strategies, recognizing individual pandas is critical. However, it remains a challenging task because the existing methods, such as traditional tracking method, discrimination method based on footprint identification, and molecular biology method, are invasive, inaccurate, expensive, or challenging to perform. The advances of imaging technologies have led to the wide applications of digital images and videos in panda conservation and management, which makes it possible for individual panda recognition in a noninvasive manner by using image-based panda face recognition method. In recent years, deep learning has achieved great success in the field of computer vision and pattern recognition. For panda face recognition, a fully automatic deep learning algorithm which consists of a sequence of deep neural networks (DNNs) used for panda face detection, segmentation, alignment, and identity prediction is developed in this study. To develop and evaluate the algorithm, the largest panda image dataset containing 6,441 images from 218 different pandas, which is 39.78% of captive pandas in the world, is established. The algorithm achieved 96.27% accuracy in panda recognition and 100% accuracy in detection. This study shows that panda faces can be used for panda recognition. It enables the use of the cameras installed in their habitat for monitoring their population and behavior. This noninvasive approach is much more cost-effective than the approaches used in the previous panda surveys. © 2020 The Authors.

In freshwater habitats, including wetlands, biodiversity is expected to decline on a greater scale than in terrestrial ecosystems. Ephemeral wetlands are little studied habitats compared to other wetlands, such as permanent lakes and rivers. The purpose of this study was to investigate the vertebrate fauna present by ephemeral vernal pools and to see whether vernal pools increase the activity and diversity of vertebrates in a boreal forest ecosystem in northern Europe. We studied the activity and species richness of birds and mammals with direct observations, camera traps, feces tracking, and snap-trapping by ten vernal pools and ten permanent wetlands. Bird activity was higher in the spring period in vernal pools than in permanent wetlands. For large mammals, both activity and species richness were greater around vernal pools than by permanent wetlands. Of individuals species, the moose (Alces alces), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), and hares (Lepus europaeus and Lepus timidus) used vernal pools significantly more between seasons compared to permanent wetlands. Small mammal activity was higher by vernal pools in April, while in May and June the pattern reversed. In the light of these results, vernal pools seem to have different importance and use depending on the vertebrate group, e.g., for sheltering, foraging, resting, nesting, or thermoregulation. © 2021 The Authors","activity; boreal forest ecosystem; community; species richness; vernal pool; vertebrate","","Anderson, J.T., Smith, L.M., Invertebrate response to moist-soil management of playa wetland (2000) Ecol.

Traditional density estimators may be inappropriate in urban areas because of extensive areas of impermeable development but new techniques that include spatial structure could be useful within large urban metropolitan areas. Yet to date, these techniques have largely remained untested. We evaluated whether spatially explicit capture-recapture models (SECR) could provide a reliable density estimate of bobcats (Lynx rufus) in the Dallas Fort-Worth metroplex, Texas, USA. We obtained 1003 photographs of bobcats in an urbanized landscape from June–November 2014, using 41 double camera stations spaced approximately 1.05 km apart. We individually identified bobcats from their distinct pelage patterns and used SECR to predict density throughout the study area. The overall density was at least one bobcat per km 2 , which calculated to approximately 43 independent-aged bobcats across the entire camera grid, an estimate higher than documented bobcat densities in both rural and peri-urban studies in Texas. Our study revealed a high density of bobcats in an urban landscape despite most assumptions that bobcats require large areas of habitat and are sensitive to fragmentation. © 2019, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Camera trap; Carnivore ecology; Lynx rufus; Population estimate; SECR model","","Adams, L.W., Urban wildlife ecology and conservation: a brief history of the discipline (2005) Urb Ecosyst, 8, pp. 139-156; Alexander, J.S., Gopalaswamy, A.M., Shi, K., Riordan, P., Face value: towards robust estimates of snow leopard densities (2015) PLoS One, 10; Alonso, R.S., (2012) The Effects of Urbanization and Road Development on Carnivores in Southern California, , Dissertation, Colorado State University; Athreya, V., Odden, M., Linnell, J.D.C., Krishnaswamy, J., Karanth, U., Big cats in our backyards: persistence of large carnivores in a human dominated landscape in India (2013) PLoS One, 8; Bashir, T., Bhattacharya, T., Poudyal, K., Sathyakumar, S., Qureshi, Q., Estimating leopard cat Prionailurus bengalensis densities using photographic captures and recaptures (2013) Wild Biol, 19, pp. 462-472; Bateman, P.W., Fleming, P.A., Big city life: carnivores in urban environments (2012) J Zool, 287, pp. 1-23; Beier, P., Dispersal of juvenile cougars in fragmented habitat (1995) J Wildl Manag, 59, pp. 228-237; Bhatia, S., Athreya, V., Grenyer, R., MacDonald, D.W., Understanding the role of representations of human-leopard conflict in Mumbai through media-content analysis (2013) Cons Biol, 27, pp. 588-594; Blanc, L., Marboutin, E., Gatti, S., Gimenez, O., Abundance of rare and elusive species: empirical investigation of closed versus spatially explicit capture–recapture models with lynx as a case study (2013) J Wildl Manag, 77, pp. 372-378; Borchers, D.L., Efford, M., Spatially explicit maximum likelihood methods for capture–recapture studies (2008) Biometrics, 64, pp. 377-385; Braczkowski, A.R., O'Bryan, C.J., Stringer, M.J., Watson, J.E., Possingham, H.P., Beyer, H.L., Leopards provide public health benefits in Mumbai, India (2018) Frontiers Ecol Environ, 16, pp. 176-182; Carbone, C., Gittleman, J.L., A common rule for the scaling of carnivore density (2002) Science, 295 (5563), pp. 2273-2276; Clare, J.D., Anderson, E.M., MacFarland, D.M., Predicting bobcat abundance at a landscape scale and evaluating occupancy as a density index in Central Wisconsin (2015) J Wild Manage, 79, pp. 469-480; Clare, J.D., Anderson, E.M., MacFarland, D.M., Sloss, B.L., Comparing the costs and detectability of bobcat using scat-detecting dog and remote camera surveys in Central Wisconsin (2015) Wild Soc Bull, 39, pp. 210-217; Crooks, K.R., Relative sensitivities of mammalian carnivores to habitat fragmentation (2002) Cons Biol, 16, pp. 488-502; Crooks, K.R., Burdett, C.L., Theobald, D.M., Rondinini, C., Boitani, L., Global patterns of fragmentation and connectivity of mammalian carnivore habitat (2011) Phil Trans R Soc London B Biol Sci, 366, pp. 2642-2651; Don Carlos, A.W., Bright, A.D., Teel, T.L., Vaske, J.J., Human–black bear conflict in urban areas: an integrated approach to management response (2009) Human Dimens Wildl, 14, pp. 174-184; Efford, M.G., (2011) Secr-Spatially Explicit Capture-Recapture in R.

Vocal signalling is, however, a flexible behaviour that involves varying costs and benefits depending on environmental, social and spatial factors. Motivated by previous data collection limitations, we developed a novel approach to investigate the influence of atmospheric conditions and animal home range geography on lion vocal behaviour using acoustic and accelerometer biologgers. To compensate for the short lifetime of the acoustic biologger, we trained a machine-learning model to detect lion roars from long-term acceleration signals which yielded over 500 nights of data from seven individual lions. Analysis of detected roar events revealed that vocalizations occurred mainly at night with a peak just before dawn. The relative likelihood of vocalization was negatively related to wind speed and temperature and positively related to absolute humidity suggesting that lions preferred to roar under conditions that reduce sound attenuation and thereby maximize calling area. Roar occurrence was found to be dependent on an animal's location relative to its home range with lions demonstrating an apparent avoidance for vocalizing beyond the home range boundary. Lions were also more likely to roar repeatedly while closer to rivers and water points within their home range. This study is the first of its kind and not only improves the understanding of lion vocal behaviour but can also inform new approaches for recording animal vocalizations remotely. © 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","biologging; Panthera leo; roar; vocal behaviour; vocalization","accelerometer; acoustic logging; cost-benefit analysis; felid; home range; machine learning; vocalization; Panthera leo","Arnold, T.W., Uninformative parameters and model selection using Akaike's information criterion (2010) Journal of Wildlife Management, 74 (6), pp. 1175-1178; Audacity(R): Free Audio Editor and Recorder.

Studies often compare the effects of livestock presence/absence but, to our knowledge, no studies have tested for interactive effects between large wild herbivores and livestock at varying stocking rates on small-bodied wild vertebrates. We investigated the effects of cattle stocking rates (none/moderate/high) on the diversity of wildlife 0.05–1,000 kg using camera traps at a long-term exclosure experiment within a semi-arid savanna ecosystem in central Kenya. In addition, by selectively excluding wild ‘mesoherbivores’ (50–1,000 kg) and ‘megaherbivores’ (>1,000 kg; elephant and giraffe), we tested whether the presence of these two wild herbivore guilds (collectively, ‘larger wild herbivores’) mediates the effect of cattle stocking rate on habitat use and diversity of ‘smaller wildlife’ (mammals ranging between 10 and 70 cm shoulder height and birds). Our results show that cattle enhance alpha diversity of smaller wildlife (with or without larger wild herbivore presence) and of all wildlife 0.05–1,000 kg (with or without megaherbivore presence), by altering vegetation structure. However, for smaller wildlife, this effect is less pronounced in the presence of larger wild herbivores, which also shorten grass. In the absence of cattle, mesoherbivore-accessible sites showed higher alpha diversity of smaller wildlife than sites excluding mesoherbivores. Smaller wildlife habitat use was increased by high cattle stocking rates and wild mesoherbivores more in the presence of the other. Synthesis and applications. Our findings imply that grazing, whether by livestock or wildlife, can enhance local savanna wildlife diversity. The biodiversity benefits of localised increases in herbivory are likely to be due to shortened grass and associated visibility improvements (for predator avoidance/foraging). This suggests that land managers can increase local biodiversity by shortening grass, with wild or domestic herbivores (or both), at least in patches within a taller grass matrix. © 2021 The Authors.

While many methods exist to estimate abundance from individually identifiable animals, it is much more difficult to estimate abundance of unmarked animals. One step toward noninvasive abundance estimation is the use of passive detectors such as remote cameras or acoustic recording devices. However, existing methods for estimating abundance from cameras for unmarked animals are limited by variable detection probability and have not taken full advantage of the information in camera trapping rate. We developed a time to event (TTE) model to estimate abundance from trapping rate. This estimate requires independent estimates of animal movement, so we collapsed the sampling occasions to create a space to event (STE) model that is not sensitive to movement rate. We further simplified the STE model into an instantaneous sampling (IS) estimator that applies fixed-area counts to cameras. The STE and IS models utilize time-lapse photographs to eliminate the variability in detection probability that comes with motion-sensor photographs. We evaluated the three methods with simulations and performed a case study to estimate elk (Cervus canadensis) abundance from remote camera trap data in Idaho. Simulations demonstrated that the TTE model is sensitive to movement rate, but the STE and IS methods are unbiased regardless of movement. In our case study, elk abundance estimates were comparable to those from a recent aerial survey in the area, demonstrating that these new methods allow biologists to estimate abundance from unmarked populations without tracking individuals over time. © 2018 The Authors.","abundance; Cervus canadensis; density; elk; exponential distribution; Poisson point process; remote camera; space to event; time to event; time-lapse photography; unmarked population","","Balestrieri, A., Ruiz-González, A., Vergara, M., Capelli, E., Tirozzi, P., Alfino, S., Minuti, G., Saino, N., Pine marten density in lowland riparian woods: a test of the Random Encounter Model based on genetic data (2016) Mammalian Biology, 81, pp. 439-446; Barker, R.J., Schofield, M.R., Link, W.A., Sauer, J.R., On the reliability of N-mixture models for count data (2017) Biometrics, 74, pp. 369-377; Berkson, J., Do radioactive decay events follow a random Poisson-exponential?

Several methods have been used to quantify hunting in past studies (e.g. interviews, ranger patrols and camera traps). However, none of these alone have been able to produce precise spatiotemporal measures of hunting activity. In this study, we used a new method to detect hunters through passive acoustic monitors and developed an integrated approach to measure hunting activity while simultaneously assessing its impacts on mammal populations using camera traps. We applied a hierarchical community occupancy model that accounted for the imperfect detection of species on data from 45 trap locations, surveyed from January to June 2018, to investigate the impacts of spatial variation and intensity in hunting pressure on mammal species richness and occurrence in four protected areas in southern Belize. We developed spatiotemporally explicit indices of hunting activity separately from camera trap and acoustic monitor data and used a Bayesian model selection framework to identify predictors of site occurrence for individual species and three functional groups: carnivores, herbivores and omnivores. We found that camera traps under-detected hunting activity in the region by 939% compared to acoustic monitors. Consistent with our predictions, hunting intensity was negatively correlated with site-level species richness, with an average decrease in richness of 31% across its range of variation. Occurrence patterns for the three functional groups were also negatively associated with hunting intensity. Often the target of hunters, herbivores, displayed the strongest negative response to hunting, while omnivores were least affected. Synthesis and applications. Unsustainable hunting of wildlife is a global phenomenon with wide-ranging implications for ecological communities, especially mammals. Our study highlights mammal sensitivity to increasing hunting pressure at the community and species level and emphasizes the necessity for developing robust tools to accurately monitor hunting activity, while also providing a flexible framework for simultaneously assessing hunting and its impacts on mammal communities. © 2020 British Ecological Society","acoustic monitor; Belize; camera trap; hunting; mammal; occupancy; poaching; protected area","bioacoustics; ecological modeling; environmental assessment; environmental impact assessment; human activity; hunting; integrated approach; mammal; protected area; spatial variation; species richness; wildlife management; Belize [Central America]; Mammalia; Varanidae","Ahumada, J.A., Hurtado, J., Lizcano, D., Monitoring the status and trends of tropical forest terrestrial vertebrate communities from camera trap data: A tool for conservation (2013) PLoS ONE, 8 (9), pp. 6-9. , https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0073707; Aiyadurai, A., Singh, N.J., Milner-Gulland, E.J., Wildlife hunting by indigenous tribes: A case study from Arunachal Pradesh, north-east India (2010) Oryx, 44 (4), pp. 564-572. , https://doi.org/10.1017/S0030605309990937; Beirne, C., Meier, A.C., Mbele, A.E., Menie Menie, G., Froese, G., Okouyi, J., Poulsen, J.R., Participatory monitoring reveals village-centered gradients of mammalian defaunation in central Africa (2019) Biological Conservation, 233 (September 2018), pp. 228-238. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2019.02.035; Benítez-López, A., Alkemade, R., Schipper, A.M., Ingram, D.J., Verweij, P.A., Schipper, A.M., Huijbregts, M.A.J., The impact of hunting on tropical mammal and bird populations (2017) Science, 356 (6334), pp. 180-183. , https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaj1891; Bennett, E.L., Robinson, J.G., (2000) Hunting of wildlife in tropical forests, , https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/101611468780290485/hunting-of-wildlife-in-tropical-forests-implications-for-biodiversity-and-forest-peoples, The World Bank, Retrieved from; Botto Nuñez, G., Lemus, G., Muñoz Wolf, M., Rodales, A.L., González, E.M., Crisci, C., The first artificial intelligence algorithm for identification of bat species in Uruguay (2018) Ecological Informatics, 46 (April 2017), pp. 97-102. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2018.05.005; Brashares, J.S., Arcese, P., Sam, M.K., Coppolillo, P.B., Sinclair, A.R.E., Balmford, A., Bushmeat hunting, wildlife declines, and fish supply in West Africa (2004) Science, 306 (November), pp. 1180-1183. , https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1102425; Brashares, J.S., Sam, M.K., How much is enough?

However, patterns of abundance for large mammals, and the effects of human disturbances on them are not well understood because we lack data at the appropriate scales. We created eMammal to effectively camera-trap at landscape scale. Camera traps detect animals with infrared sensors that trigger the camera to take a photo, a sequence of photos, or a video clip. Through photography, camera traps create records of wildlife from known locations and dates, and can be set in arrays to quantify animal distribution across a landscape. This allows linkage to other distributed networks of ecological data. Objectives: Through the eMammal program, we demonstrate that volunteer-based camera trapping can meet landscape scale spatial data needs, while also engaging the public in nature and science. We assert that camera surveys can be effectively scaled to a macrosystem level through citizen science, but only after solving challenges of data and volunteer management. Method: We present study design and technology solutions for landscape scale camera trapping to effectively recruit, train and retain volunteers while providing efficient data workflows and quality control. Results: Our initial work with > 400 volunteers across six contiguous U.S. states has proven that citizen scientists can deploy these camera traps properly (94 % of volunteer deployments correct) and tag the photos accurately for most species (67–100 %). Using these tools we processed 2.6 million images over a 2 year period. The eMammal cyberinfrastructure made it possible to process far more data than any participating researcher had previously achieved. The core components include an upload application using a standard metadata format, an expert review tool to ensure data quality, and a curated data repository. Conclusion: Macrosystem scale monitoring of wildlife by volunteer-run camera traps can produce the data needed to address questions concerning broadly distributed mammals, and also help to raise public awareness on the science of conservation. This scale of data will allow for linkage of large mammals to ecosystem processes now measured through national programs. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA).","Camera traps; Citizen science; Cyberinfrastructure; eMammal; Macrosystem; Standard metadata","Animalia; Mammalia","Bonter, D.N., Cooper, C.B., Data validation in citizen science: a case study from project FeederWatch (2012) Front Ecol Environ, 10, pp. 305-307; Brossard, D., Lewenstein, B., Bonney, R., Scientific knowledge and attitude change: the impact of a citizen science project (2005) Int J Sci Educ, 27, pp. 1099-1121; Butcher, G.S., Niven, D.K., (2007) Combining data from the christmas bird count and the breeding bird survey to determine the continental status and trends of North America birds, , National Audubon Society, Ivylan; Carbone, C., Christie, S., Conforti, K., Coulson, T., Franklin, N., Ginsberg, J.R., Griffiths, M., Wan Shahruddin, W.N., The use of photographic rates to estimate densities of tigers and other cryptic mammals (2001) Anim Conserv, 4, pp. 75-79; Chang, C.-C., Lin, C.-J., LIBSVM: a library for support vector machines (2011) ACM Trans Intell Syst Technol, 2 (3), p. 27; Cohn, J.P., Citizen science: can volunteers do real research?

Unfortunately, they were released into the wild during religious events and have since begun to impact the native ecosystem and species endemic to South Korea. The study of activity patterns can improve our understanding of the environmental impact of non-native species and their association with sympatric species. Using camera traps, we studied the diel and seasonal activity patterns of non-native sika deer and quantified the temporal overlap with sympatric mammalian species in the Muljangori-oreum wetlands of Hallasan National Park, South Korea. Results: A total of 970 trap events were recorded for five mammalian species from nine locations during the camera-trap survey. Siberian roe deer (Capreoluspygargus tianschanicus) had the highest number of recorded events (72.0%), followed by sika deer (Cervus nippon) (16.2%), wild boar (Sus scrofa) (5.0%), Asian badger (Meles leucurus) (4.5%), and the Jeju weasel (Mustela sibirica quelpartis) (2.0%). Sika deer had bimodal activity patterns throughout the year, with peaks throughout the spring-autumn twilight, and day and night time throughout the winter. Relating the daily activity of sika deer with other mammalian species, roe deer expressed the highest degree of overlap (∆4 = 0.80) while the Asian badger demonstrated the lowest overlap (∆4 = 0.37). Conclusions: Our data show that sika deer are a crepuscular species with seasonal variations in daily activity patterns. Additionally, we identified the temporal differences in activity peaks between different mammals in the Muljangori-oreum wetlands and found higher degree of overlap between sika deer and roe deer during twilight hours. © 2021, The Author(s).","Camera traps; Diel activity; Management; Sika deer; Sympatric species","","Adhikari, P., Jeon, J., Kim, H.W., Shin, M., Adhikari, P., Seo, C., Potential impact of climate change on plant invasion in the Republic of Korea (2019) J Ecol Environ, 43 (1), p. 36; Adhikari, P., Park, S.M., Kim, T.W., Lee, J.W., Kim, G.R., Han, S.H., Oh, H.S., Seasonal and altitudinal variation in roe deer (Capreolus pygargus tianschanicus) diet on Jeju Island, South Korea (2016) J Asia-Pacific Biodivers, 9 (4), pp. 422-428; Arnold, W., Ruf, T., Reimoser, S., Tataruch, F., Onderscheka, K., Schober, F., Nocturnal hypometabolism as an overwintering strategy of red deer (Cervus elaphus) (2004) Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol, 286, pp. 174-181; McCullough DR, Kaji K, Takatsuki S (Eds) Sika deer.

It can quickly generate large amounts of data which need to be managed in an efficient and transparent way that links data acquisition with analytical tools. We describe the free and open-source R package camtrapR, a new toolbox for flexible and efficient management of data generated in camera trap-based wildlife studies. The package implements a complete workflow for processing camera trapping data. It assists in image organization, species and individual identification, data extraction from images, tabulation and visualization of results and export of data for subsequent analyses. There is no limitation to the number of images stored in this data management system; the system is portable and compatible across operating systems. The functions provide extensive automation to minimize data entry mistakes and, apart from species and individual identification, require minimal manual user input. Species and individual identification are performed outside the R environment, either via tags assigned in dedicated image management software or by moving images into species directories. Input for occupancy and (spatial) capture–recapture analyses for density and abundance estimation, for example in the R packages unmarked or secr, is computed in a flexible and reproducible manner. In addition, survey summary reports can be generated, spatial distributions of records can be plotted and exported to gis software, and single- and two-species activity patterns can be visualized. camtrapR allows for streamlined and flexible camera trap data management and should be most useful to researchers and practitioners who regularly handle large amounts of camera trapping data. © 2016 The Authors.

Incubation is, however, a challenging phenomenon to observe and studies generally either measure some proxy of the target behavior, or risk disturbing birds through direct observation. More recently, nest cameras have provided a non-intrusive way to directly observe incubation, but analysis of these data is time-consuming. Here, we use the results of the first deep learning model which automated analysis of nest camera video recordings from eight purple martin (Progne subis) nests over the entire incubation period at a 1-s resolution. We mathematically define the initiation of incubation, characterize the change in nest attentiveness during incubation, and analyze the factors determining nest attentiveness and on- and off-bout duration during the incubation process. A random forest regression model identified the most important predictors of nest attentiveness. Attentiveness decreased with increasing temperature, but the strength of this response increased above the presumed physiological zero egg temperature, below which egg development ceases. This implies that the purple martins are able to adjust their incubation behavior in a complex, multiple-state manner to an extrinsic stimulus. Our study highlights the value of high-resolution datasets created using artificial intelligence for the analysis of nest camera video recordings of animal behavior. Significance statement: The use of artificial intelligence for image classification tasks is becoming commonplace in society. This technology is beginning to be used to automate the analysis of video recordings of wildlife behavior. Here, we use the results of the first such classification from nest camera video recordings of the purple martin (Progne subis) to determine the factors affecting incubation attentiveness (the proportion of time that the adults spend in contact with eggs). Incubation attentiveness is important because it can affect hatch rate and have carry-over effects both for the condition of the incubating adults and the quality of the resulting offspring. Our analysis found that attentiveness was mainly affected by ambient temperature, with incubating adults reducing their efforts as ambient temperature reaches the minimum threshold for egg development. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Ambient temperature; Deep learning; Incubation; Nest cameras; Physiological zero; Purple martins","artificial intelligence; egg development; fitness; image classification; incubation; nest; passerine; physiology; regression analysis; temperature effect; videography; Animalia; Aves; Progne; Progne subis","Aldrich, T.W., Raveling, D.G., Effects of experience and body-weight on incubation behavior of Canada geese (1983) Auk, 100, pp. 670-679; Allen, R.W., Nice, M.M., A study of the breeding biology of the purple martin (Progne subis) (1952) Am Midl Nat, 47, pp. 606-665; Amininasab, S.M., Kingma, S.A., Birker, M., Hildenbrandt, H., Komdeur, J., The effect of ambient temperature, habitat quality and individual age on incubation behaviour and incubation feeding in a socially monogamous songbird (2016) Behav Ecol Sociobiol, 70, pp. 1591-1600. , PID: 27546954; Ardia, D.R., Pérez, J.H., Clotfelter, E.D., Experimental cooling during incubation leads to reduced innate immunity and body condition in nestling tree swallows (2010) Proc R Soc Lond B, 277, pp. 1881-1888; Arnold, T.W., Factors affecting egg viability and incubation time in prairie dabbling ducks (1993) Can J Zool, 71, pp. 1146-1152; Bartoń, K., (2018) Mumin: Multi-Model Inference, , https://cran.r-project.org/package=MuMIn, R package version 1.42.1; Bates, D., Maechler, M., Bolker, B., Walker, S., Fitting linear mixed-effects models using lme4 (2015) J Stat Softw, 67, pp. 1-48; Blackmer, A.L., Ackerman, J.T., Nevitt, G.A., Effects of investigator disturbance on hatching success and nest-site fidelity in a long-lived seabird, Leach’s storm petrel (2004) Biol Conserv, 116, pp. 141-148; Blagosklonov, K.N., Experimental-analysis of rhythm of incubation in pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) (1977) Sov J Ecol, 8, pp. 340-344; Bogdanova, M.I., Nager, R.G., Monaghan, P., Age of the incubating parents affects nestling survival: an experimental study of the herring gull Larus argentatus (2007) J Avian Biol, 38, pp. 83-93; Bottitta, G.E., Gilchrist, H.G., Kift, A., Meredith, M.G., A pressure-sensitive wireless device for continuously monitoring avian nest attendance (2002) Wildlife Soc B, 30, pp. 1033-1038; Breheny, P., Burchett, W., Visualization of Regression Models Using visreg (2017) The R Journal, 9 (2), p. 56; Brown, P.W., Fredrickson, L.H., Time budget and incubation behavior of breeding white winged scoters (1987) Wilson Bull, 99, pp. 50-55; Conway, C.J., Martin, T.E., Effects of ambient temperature on avian incubation behavior (2000) Behav Ecol, 11, pp. 178-188; Cook, M.I., Beissinger, S.R., Toranzos, G.A., Arendt, W.J., Incubation reduces microbial growth on eggshells and the opportunity for trans-shell infection (2005) Ecol Lett, 8, pp. 532-537. , PID: 21352457; Cooper, C.B., Voss, M.A., Avian incubation patterns reflect temporal changes in developing clutches (2013) PLoS One, 8. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3sXhtVKltbzM, PID: 23840339; Cox, W.A., Pruett, M.S., Benson, T.J., Chiavacci, S.J., Thompson, F.R., III, Development of camera technology for monitoring nests (2012) Video surveillance of nesting birds, pp. 185-209. , Ribic CA, Thompson FR, Pietz PJ, (eds), University of California Press, Berkeley; Dallmann, J.D., Anderson, L.C., Raynor, E.J., Powell, L.A., Schacht, W.H., iButton® temperature loggers effectively determine prairie grouse nest absences (2016) Great Plains Res, 26, pp. 117-123; Davidar, P., Morton, E.S., Living with parasites - prevalence of a blood parasite and its effect on survivorship in the purple martin (1993) Auk, 110, pp. 109-116; Davis, S.K., Holmes, T.G., Sprague’s pipit incubation behavior (2012) Video surveillance of nesting birds, pp. 67-76. , Ribic CA, Thompson FR, Pietz PJ, (eds), University of California Press, Berkeley; Deeming, D.C., (2002) Avian incubation.

As with many other Southeast Asian turtles, low densities of individuals and few remaining populations have limited our ability to study, and thus understand, the ecology of this stream-dwelling species. We conducted a radiotelemetry study on 31 adult big-headed turtles to investigate their home range, movements, and habitat use. The home ranges of big-headed turtles were small, with a mean 100% home-range length of 97m and 100% minimum convex polygon size of 996m2. Movements by male and female big-headed turtles did not differ and both sexes moved longer distances in wet seasons than in dry seasons. Both males and females showed non-random habitat use, preferring to stay in pools rather than in other in-stream or terrestrial habitats. Stream width and depth, and substrate type affected microhabitat use. Big-headed turtles were highly aquatic and movements in terrestrial habitats were rare. Thus, turtle populations are concentrated in streams where they may be easily targeted by illegal trappers. We recommend increasing patrol efforts along streams to remove any traps or fish hooks. Innovative methods, such as installation of infrared-triggered cameras equipped with remote viewing near or along streams, may be needed to tackle illegal turtle trapping effectively. © 2015 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2015.","habitat use; home range; movement; Platysternon megacephalum; radio-tracking; turtle conservation","endangered species; habitat use; home range; microhabitat; movement; population decline; radiotelemetry; remote sensing; spatial analysis; species conservation; stream; trapping; turtle; videography; vulnerability; Southeast Asia; Platysternidae; Platysternon megacephalum; Testudines","Aebischer, N.J., Robertson, P.A., Kenward, R.E., Compositional analysis of habitat use from animal radio-tracking data (1993) Ecology, 74, pp. 1313-1325; Bodie, J.R., Semlitsch, R.D., Spatial and temporal use of floodplain habitats by lentic and lotic species of aquatic turtles (2000) Oecologia, 122, pp. 138-146; Bonin, F., Devaux, B., Dupre, A., (2006) Turtles of the World, , Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, Maryland, USA; Buhlmann, K.A., Akre, T.S.B., Iverson, J.B., Karapatakis, D., Mittermeier, R.A., Georges, A., Rhodin, A.G.J., Gibbons, J.W., A global analysis of tortoise and freshwater turtle distributions with identification of priority conservation areas (2009) Chelonian Conservation and Biology, 8, pp. 116-149; Burke, V.J., Lovich, J.E., Gibbons, J.W., Conservation of freshwater turtles.

An average of 51 game cameras were set up at shoreline haul-out sites in central Lake Saimaa during the moulting seasons in each of the years from 2010 to 2014. Individuals were identified from their lifelong unique lateral fur patterns. A total of 220 000 digital images of seals were obtained from these game cameras and from digital cameras during this period, allowing 164 individuals to be identified, 43% of which were re-sighted in successive years. In the majority of game camera images, both sides of the seal were shown, and it was possible to determine the sex of the seal. The average distance between sightings of individual seals in different years was 1.6 km, suggesting that Saimaa ringed seals exhibit a high degree of moulting site fidelity. In addition, the results support suggestions of natal site fidelity. We propose that photo-ID sampling based on camera traps, and larger-scale photographic survey of the seals, should be implemented as a population monitoring tool of the Saimaa ringed seal. Further application of the photo-ID technique may facilitate mark-recapture population and survival rate estimates for this threatened seal species and provide significant insights into its life history and social behaviour. © The authors 2016. © 2014.","Camera trapping;

However, insufficient attention has been paid to testing their performance, particularly under field conditions. In this study, we have comparatively tested five of the most frequently used makes of camera trap (Bushnell, KeepGuard, Ltl Acorn, Reconyx and Scoutguard) to identify the key factors behind their probability of detection (i.e. the probability that the camera successfully capturing a usable photograph of an animal passing through the field of view) and trigger speed (i.e. the time delay between the instant at which a motion is detected, and the time at which the picture is taken). We used 45 cameras (nine devices of each make) with infrared flash in a field experiment in which a continuous remote video was used in parallel (as a gold-standard) to discover the animals that entered the camera trap detection zone. The period (day/night), distance between animals and cameras, model, species, deployment height and activation sensitivity were significantly related to the probability of detection. This probability was lower during the night than during the day. There was a greater probability of detecting a given species when the cameras were set at its shoulder height. The interaction between species and the distance between the animals and the cameras significantly affected the trigger speed, meaning that the closer the animals that entered the detection zone, the higher the trigger speed, with substantial differences among species. This was probably related by movement speed. In conclusion, this study shows differences in the performance of camera trap models and settings, signifying that caution is required when making direct comparisons among results obtained in different experiments, or when designing new ones. These results provide empirical guidelines for best practices in camera trapping and highlight the relevance of field experiments for testing the performance of the camera traps. © 2021 The Authors.

Box 54667-00200, Kenya","Wildlife counts in Africa and elsewhere are often implemented using light aircraft with ‘rear-seat-observer’ (RSO) counting crews. Previous research has indicated that RSOs often fail to detect animals, and that population estimates are therefore biased. We conducted aerial wildlife surveys in Murchison Falls Protected Area, Uganda, in which we replaced RSOs with high-definition ‘oblique camera count’ (OCC) systems. The survey area comprises forests, woodlands and grasslands. Four counts were conducted in 2015–2016 using a systematic-reconnaissance-flight (SRF) strip-transect design. Camera inclination angles, focal lengths, altitude and frame interval were calibrated to provide imaged strips of known sample size on the left and right sides of the aircraft. Using digital cameras, 24 000 high-definition images were acquired for each count, which were visually interpreted by four airphoto interpreters. We used the standard Jolly II SRF analysis to derive population estimates. Our OCC estimates of the antelopes – hartebeest, Uganda kob, waterbuck and oribi – were, respectively, 25%, 103%, 97% and 2100% higher than in the most recent RSO count conducted in 2014. The OCC surveys doubled the 2014 RSO estimate of 58 000 Uganda kob to over 118 000. Population size estimates of elephants and giraffes did not differ significantly. Although all four OCC buffalo estimates were higher than the RSO estimates – in one count by 60% – these differences were not significant due to the clumped distribution and high variation in herd sizes, resulting in imprecise estimation by sampling. We conclude that RSO wildlife counts in Murchison have been effective in enumerating elephants and giraffe, but that many smaller species have not been well detected. We emphasize the importance of 60 years of RSO-based surveys across Africa, but suggest that new imaging technologies are embraced to improve accuracy. © 2020 2020 The Authors.

Assessing possible negative impacts of recreation is nevertheless important for sustainable management. Here, we used camera traps to assess relative effects of various recreational activities—as compared to each other and to environmental conditions—on a terrestrial wildlife assemblage in British Columbia, Canada. Across 13 species, only two negative associations between recreational activities and wildlife detections were observed at weekly scales: mountain biking on moose and grizzly bears. However, finer-scale analysis showed that all species avoided humans on trails, with avoidance strongest for mountain biking and motorized vehicles. Our results imply that environmental factors generally shaped broad-scale patterns of wildlife use, but highlight that recreational activities also have detectable impacts. These impacts can be monitored using the same camera-trapping techniques that are commonly used to monitor wildlife assemblages. © 2020 The Authors.

Here, we developed a machine learning algorithm using a low-cost computer. We trained a convolutional neural network and tested its performance in: (1) distinguishing focal organisms of three marine taxa (Australian fur seals, loggerhead sea turtles and Australasian gannets; body size ranges: 0.8–2.5 m, 0.6–1.0 m, and 0.8–0.9 m, respectively); and (2) simultaneously delineating the fine-scale movement trajectories of multiple sea turtles at a fish cleaning station. For all species, the algorithm performed best at detecting individuals of similar body length, displaying consistent behaviour or occupying uniform habitat (proportion of individuals detected, or recall of 0.94, 0.79 and 0.75 for gannets, seals and turtles, respectively). For gannets, performance was impacted by spacing (huddling pairs with offspring) and behaviour (resting vs. flying shapes, overall precision: 0.74). For seals, accuracy was impacted by morphology (sexual dimorphism and pups), spacing (huddling and creches) and habitat complexity (seal sized boulders) (overall precision: 0.27). For sea turtles, performance was impacted by habitat complexity, position in water column, spacing, behaviour (interacting individuals) and turbidity (overall precision: 0.24); body size variation had no impact. For sea turtle trajectories, locations were estimated with a relative positioning error of <50 cm. In conclusion, we demonstrate that, while the same machine learning algorithm can be used to survey multiple species, no single algorithm captures all components optimally within a given site. We recommend that, rather than attempting to fully automate detection of UAV imagery data, semi-automation is implemented (i.e. part automated and part manual, as commonly practised for photo-identification). Approaches to enhance the efficiency of manual detection are required in parallel to the development of effective implementation of machine learning algorithms. © 2021 Deakin Univeristy.

As a consequence there is a growing demand for computer procedures to assist users in photo-recognition of an individual. We present a new software for photo-matching developed to minimize the pre-processing time and maximize the speed of the matching procedure. In APHIS photos can be processed in batches of hundreds and users can select between two alternative matching procedures, one interactive, built as an extension of existing and freely available software, and one automatic. We assessed its performance in terms of individual recognition and time efficiency and illustrate its use with real capture-photo-recapture studies on a reptile and an amphibian species, the Balearic Lizard Podiarcis lilfordi and the Northern spectacled salamander Salamandrina perspicillata, with contrasting skin patterns. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Capture-recapture; Individual-based data; Marking; Photo-identification","amphibian; body condition; data processing; lizard; marking method; performance assessment; skin; software; theoretical study; Amphibia; Reptilia; Salamandrina perspicillata; Salamandrina terdigitata; Squamata","Bolger, D.T., Morrison, T.A., Vance, B., Lee, D., Farid, H., A computer-assisted system for photographic mark-recapture analysis (2012) Methods Ecol.

In this paper, a two-stage identification method of sick chicken based on deep learning is proposed, Firstly, improved Faster RCNN model was used to locate the the regions of chicken, head and body, Then, the deep features of above three image blocks are extracted, cascading feature vectors of the regions for identification of sick chickens. In the experiment, the caged white feather chicken was taken as the research object, the data sets was made, and the model was designed, trained and tested. In the comparative experiment of localization, The average accuracy of this model is 10.6 pixel distance, and the mean average precision(mAP) of region classification is 91.2%. In the comparative experiment of sick chicken identification, The fusion features classification achieved the best effect, followed by the head features, the body features was the worst. The recall of the fusion features classification is 91.95%, the accuracy is 88.41%, and the F1 index is 89.93%.

Group territory size and territory overlap and components of spatial organization, provide key information as these metrics may be indicators of habitat quality, resource dispersion, contact rates and environmental risk (e.g. indirectly transmitted pathogens). Furthermore, sociality and behaviour can also shape space use, and subsequently, how space use and habitat quality together impact demography. Our study aims to identify factors shaping the spatial organization of wildlife populations and assess the impact of epizootics on space use. We further aim to explore the mechanisms by which disease perturbations could cause changes in spatial organization. Here we assessed the seasonal spatial organization of Serengeti lions and Yellowstone wolves at the group level. We use network analysis to describe spatial organization and connectivity of social groups. We then examine the factors predicting mean territory size and mean territory overlap for each population using generalized additive models. We demonstrate that lions and wolves were similar in that group-level factors, such as number of groups and shaped spatial organization more than population-level factors, such as population density. Factors shaping territory size were slightly different than factors shaping territory overlap; for example, wolf pack size was an important predictor of territory overlap, but not territory size. Lion spatial networks were more highly connected, while wolf spatial networks varied seasonally. We found that resource dispersion may be more important for driving territory size and overlap for wolves than for lions. Additionally, canine distemper epizootics may have altered lion spatial organization, highlighting the importance of including infectious disease epizootics in studies of behavioural and movement ecology. We provide insight about when we might expect to observe the impacts of resource dispersion, disease perturbations, and other ecological factors on spatial organization. Our work highlights the importance of monitoring and managing social carnivore populations at the group level. Future research should elucidate the complex relationships between demographics, social and spatial structure, abiotic and biotic conditions and pathogen infections. © 2020 British Ecological Society","disease; lion; network; resource dispersion; spatial oganization; territoriality; territory overlap; wolf","canid; carnivore; connectivity; disease prevalence; environmental risk; felid; group size; habitat quality; habitat structure; niche overlap; population density; seasonality; social organization; territory; Serengeti; Tanzania; Canidae; animal; Carnivora; ecosystem; lion; season; wolf; Animals; Carnivora; Ecosystem; Lions; Seasons; Wolves","Alberts, S.C., Social influences on survival and reproduction: Insights from a long-term study of wild baboons (2019) Journal of Animal Ecology, 88, pp. 47-66. , https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12887; Almberg, E.S., Cross, P.C., Dobson, A.P., Smith, D.W., Metz, M.C., Stahler, D.R., Hudson, P.J., Social living mitigates the costs of a chronic illness in a cooperative carnivore (2015) Ecology Letters, 18, pp. 660-667. , https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.12444; Almberg, E.S., Mech, L.D., Smith, D.W., Sheldon, J.W., Crabtree, R.L., A serological survey of infectious disease in Yellowstone National Park’s canid community (2009) PLoS ONE, 4. , https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0007042; Apps, C.D., McLellan, B.N., Woods, J.G., Landscape partitioning and spatial inferences of competition between black and grizzly bears (2006) Ecography, 29, pp. 561-572. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0906-7590.2006.04564.x; Arden-Clarke, C.H.G., Population density, home range size and spatial organization of the Cape clawless otter, Aonyx capensis, in a marine habitat (1986) Journal of Zoology, 209, pp. 201-211. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.1986.tb03576.x; Armansin, N.C., Stow, A.J., Cantor, M., Leu, S.T., Klarevas-Irby, J.A., Chariton, A.A., Farine, D.R., Social barriers in ecological landscapes: The social resistance hypothesis (2019) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 35 (2), pp. 137-148. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2019.10.001; Baird, R.W., Whitehead, H., Social organization of mammal-eating killer whales: Group stability and dispersal patterns (2000) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 78, pp. 2096-2105. , https://doi.org/10.1139/z00-155; Bartnick, T.D., Van Deelen, T.R., Quigley, H.B., Craighead, D., Variation in cougar (Puma concolor) predation habits during wolf (Canis lupus) recovery in the southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (2013) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 91, pp. 82-93. , https://doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2012-0147; Bateman, A.W., Lewis, M.A., Gall, G., Manser, M.B., Clutton-Brock, T.H., Territoriality and home-range dynamics in meerkats, Suricata suricatta: A mechanistic modelling approach (2015) Journal of Animal Ecology, 84, pp. 260-271. , https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12267; Belcher, C.A., Darrant, J.P., Home range and spatial organization of the marsupial carnivore, Dasyurus maculatus maculatus (Marsupialia: Dasyuridae) in south-eastern Australia (2004) Journal of Zoology, 262, pp. 271-280. , https://doi.org/10.1017/S0952836903004631; Benson, J.F., Chamberlain, M.J., Leopold, B.D., Land tenure and occupation of vacant home ranges by bobcats (Lynx rufus) (2004) Journal of Mammalogy, 85, pp. 983-988. , https://doi.org/10.1644/BWG-132; Berger, K.M., Gese, E.M., Does interference competition with wolves limit the distribution and abundance of coyotes?

While remote camera traps collect field data with minimal human attention, the images they collect require post-processing and characterization before it can be ecologically and statistically analyzed, requiring the input of substantial time and money from researchers. The need for post-processing is due, in part, to a high incidence of non-target images. We developed a stand-alone semi-automated computer program to aid in image processing, categorization, and data reduction by employing background subtraction and histogram rules. Unlike previous work that uses video as input, our program uses still camera trap images. The program was developed for an ungulate fence crossing project and tested against an image dataset which had been previously processed by a human operator. Our program placed images into categories representing the confidence of a particular sequence of images containing a fence crossing event. This resulted in a reduction of 54.8% of images that required further human operator characterization while retaining 72.6% of the known fence crossing events. This program can provide researchers using remote camera data the ability to reduce the time and cost required for image post-processing and characterization. Further, we discuss how this procedure might be generalized to situations not specifically related to animal use of linear features. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Camera trap; Computer vision; Image processing; Monitoring; Remote camera","Automation; Cameras; Characterization; Computer vision; Data reduction; Fences; Monitoring; Software testing; Background subtraction; High incidence; Human attention; Human operator; Image datasets; Post processing; Remote cameras; Sequence of images; Image processing; computer vision; data set; detection method; image processing; monitoring; software; ungulate; animal use; classification; histogram; human; human experiment; image processing; monitoring; nonhuman; scientist; software; ungulate; videorecording; vision; animal; devices; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; image processing; mammal; procedures; Animalia; Ungulata; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Mammals","Anderson, C.J., Lobo, N.D.V., Roth, J.D., Waterman, J.M., Computer-aided photo-identification system with an application to polar bears based on whisker spot patterns (2010) Journal of Mammalogy, 91, pp. 1350-1359; Ardekani, R., Greenwood, A.K., Peichel, C.L., Tavaré, S., Automated quantification of the schooling behaviour of sticklebacks (2013) EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing, 2013, pp. 1-8; Bubnicki, J.W., Churski, M., Kuijper, D.P., (2016) TRAPPER: an open source web-based application to manage camera trapping projects, , Methods in Ecology and Evolution; Burton, A.C., Neilson, E., Moreira, D., Ladle, A., Steenweg, R., Fisher, J.T., Bayne, E., Boutin, S., REVIEW: Wildlife camera trapping: a review and recommendations for linking surveys to ecological processes (2015) Journal of Applied Ecology, 52, pp. 675-685; Efford, M., Density estimation in live-trapping studies (2004) Oikos, 106, pp. 598-610; Forrester, T., McShea, W.J., Keys, R., Costello, R., Baker, M., Parsons, A., (2013) emammal–citizen science camera trapping as a solution for broad-scale, long-term monitoring of wildlife populations, , Sustainable Pathways, Learning from the Past and Shaping the Future; Goehner, K., Desell, T., Eckroad, R., Mohsenian, L., Burr, P., Caswell, N., Andes, A., Ellis-Felege, S., (2015) A comparison of background subtraction algorithms for detecting avian nesting events in uncontrolled outdoor video.

Habitat differences can affect demographic rates, which may in turn impact the speed of the invasion, but this has been rarely addressed. We studied the demography of invasive North American beavers (Castor canadensis) in 2 contrasting habitat types of the island, forest and steppe, on Tierra del Fuego in southern Patagonia. We used repeated observations, mark-resight methods, telemetry, and camera traps to estimate colony size and demographic rates of beavers in the 2 habitats. Colony size and the number of offspring (“kits”) produced per colony per year were higher in the steppe, contrary to the belief that forest is better habitat. This may be the result of the longer time since invasion in the forests of Tierra del Fuego and that the forest subpopulation is showing density-dependent regulation. Survival of beavers was high in all age classes and was higher than survival rates recorded in North America. Our work shows that plasticity of habitat use and predator release have likely facilitated beaver invasion in Patagonia. The higher productivity and detectability of beavers in the steppe call for active management in a habitat previously assumed to be subprime. © 2016 American Society of Mammalogists, www.mammalogy.org","Biological invasions; Castor canadensis; Density dependence; Habitat heterogeneity; Patagonia; Predator release","biological invasion; biotelemetry; demography; density dependence; forest-steppe; habitat type; heterogeneity; invasive species; rodent; subpopulation; survival; Argentina; North America; Patagonia; Tierra del Fuego [(PRV) Argentina]; Castor canadensis; Castoridae","Anderson, C.B., Griffith, C.R., Rosemond, A.D., Rozzi, R., Dollenz, O., The effects of invasive North American beavers on riparian plant communities in Cape Horn, Chile: Do exotic beavers engineer differently in sub-Antarctic ecosystems?

Methods used to sample these lizards in the field are a subset of those available worldwide, but include some notable adaptions, novel designs and techniques originally developed for the detection and monitoring of pest mammals. This chapter describes current standard field methods (systematic searching, live trapping and artificial retreats) alongside less frequently used methods (adhesive traps, detector dogs, camera stations and footprint tracking), some of which are still under development or have restricted use. We also discuss the main methods used for individual identification of New Zealand lizards: temporary marking, toe-clipping and photo-identification. When coupled with a thorough understanding of lizard behaviour and ecology, these methods collectively permit effective sampling of the majority of the New Zealand lizard fauna. Arboreal species require further attention, as does the development of accurate, fast and ethically acceptable methods for permanent marking. © 2016 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Adhesive traps; Artificial retreats; Camera stations; Detector dogs; Footprint tracking; Funnel trapping; Gecko; Photo-identification; Pitfall trapping; Skink; Systematic searching; Toe-clipping","","Anastasiadis, J.M., Whitaker, A.H., Longevity of free-living Hoplodactylus maculatus (Reptilia: Gekkonidae) (1987) N Z J Ecol, 10, pp. 141-142; Ariefiandy, A., Purwandana, D., Seno, A., Ciofi, C., Jessop, T.S., Can camera traps monitor Komodo dragons a large ectothermic predator?

The potential advantages of such methods over traditional direct monitoring (such as live capture) are that accuracy improves because sampling of non-trappable individuals may be possible, species in difficult and remote terrain can be surveyed more efficiently, and disturbance to animals is minimal. Few studies have assessed the effects of interactions between species on remote sampling success. We test the use of non-invasive monitoring for the cryptic, forest-dwelling, solitary and endangered bridled nailtail wallaby (Onychogalea fraenata) that is sympatric with the ecologically similar and more common black-striped wallaby (Macropus dorsalis). Six types of hair traps were tested for 3668 trap days, and hairs were caught with about a 10% success rate. Camera traps showed that baited hair traps targeted both wallaby species. We microscopically identified hair as bridled nailtail wallaby or black-striped wallaby. We compared these hairs and their genotypes (using seven microsatellite loci) with known bridled nailtail wallaby hairs and genotypes derived from animal trapping. Trapped bridled nailtail wallaby hairs had characteristics that could be mistaken for black-stripe wallaby hairs; characteristics were not diagnostic. Genetic assignment tests consistently differentiated the known bridled nailtail wallaby samples from identified black-striped wallaby samples, however genetic overlap between most of the microsatellite markers means that they are not suitable for species identification of single samples, with the possible exception of the microsatellite locus B151. With similar trapping effort and within the same area, live-capture mark-recapture techniques estimated 40-60 individuals and non-invasive methods only detected 14 genotypes. A species-specific genetic marker would allow more efficient targeting of bridled nailtail wallaby samples and increase capture rates. © 2014 Ecological Society of Australia.","Bridled nailtail wallaby; Genotyping; Hair species identification; Non-invasive; Onychogalea fraenata","genetic analysis; genetic marker; genotype; hair; mammal; mark-recapture method; monitoring system; terrain; trapping; Animalia; Macropus; Macropus dorsalis; Mammalia; Onychogalea fraenata","Améndola-Pimenta, M., García-Feria, L., Serio-Silva, J.C., Rico-Gray, V., Noninvasive collection of fresh hairs from free-ranging howler monkeys for DNA extraction (2009) Am.

We combined intensive camera trapping data with Bayesian occurrence probability models to evaluate both diurnal and nocturnal patterns of space use by carnivores in a mosaic of land-use types in southern Chile. A total of eight carnivores species were recorded, including human-introduced dogs. During the day the most frequently detected species were the culpeo fox and the cougar. Conversely, during the night, the kodkod and chilla fox were the most detected species. The best supported models showed that native carnivores responded differently to landscape attributes and dogs depending on both the time of day as well as the spatial scale of landscape attributes. The positive effect of native forest cover at 250m and 500 m radius buffers was stronger during the night for the Darwin's fox and cougar. Road density at 250m scale negatively affected the diurnal occurrence of Darwin's fox, whereas at 500m scale roads had a stronger negative effect on the diurnal occurrence of Darwin's foxes and cougars. A positive effect of road density on dog occurrence was evidenced during both night and day. Patch size had a positive effect on cougar occurrence during night whereas it affected negatively the occurrence of culpeo foxes and skunks during day. Dog occurrence had a negative effect on Darwin's fox occurrence during day-time and night-time, whereas its negative effect on the occurrence of cougar was evidenced only during day-time. Carnivore occurrences were not influenced by the proximity to a conservation area. Our results provided support for the hypothesis that diurnal changes to carnivore occurrence were associated with human and dog activity. Landscape planning in our study area should be focused in reducing both the levels of diurnal human activity in native forest remnants and the dispersion rates of dogs into these habitats. © 2015 Moreira-Arce et al.","","Article; Bayes theorem; carnivore; Chile; circadian rhythm; density; dog; forest; fox; human; introduced species; land use; landscape; native species; night; nonhuman; population dispersion; Puma concolor; skunk; species conservation; species habitat; species identification; animal; biological model; fox; Puma; Animals; Dogs; Foxes; Humans; Introduced Species; Models, Biological; Puma","Battin, J., When good animals love bad habitats: Ecological traps and the conservation of animal populations (2004) Conservation Biology, 18, pp. 1482-1491; Thomas, D.L., Taylor, E.J., Study designs and tests for comparing resources use and availability (2006) Journal of Wildlife Management, 70, pp. 324-336; Gaillard, J.M., Hebblewhite, M., Loison, A., Fuller, M., Powell, R., Basille, M., Habitat-performance relationships: Finding the right metric at a given spatial scale (2010) Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci., 365, pp. 2255-2265. , 20566502; Woodroffe, R., Ginsberg, J.R., Conserving the African wild dog Lycaon pictus.

Sometimes, these accumulations serve specific functions (e.g. structural or isolating features) or are purely incidental, while in other cases the materials are deliberately displayed to serve signalling purposes (extended phenotype signals). In this pilot study, we employed systematic in situ observations and camera trapping to describe for the first time that both partners of a territorial shorebird, the black-faced sheathbill (Chionis minor ssp minor) collect, carry, and arrange colourful marine shells and dry twigs within and around their nest cavity. Our observations expand the taxonomic breadth of avian extended phenotype signals, by showing that at least one species within a largely understudied group i.e., Charadriiformes, exhibits nest-decoration behaviour. Multiple manipulative experiments are needed to explore further the signalling function of these decorations, which opens new exciting avenues for animal communication and cognition research. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Animal communication; Charadrius; Extended phenotype; Nest decoration; Non-bodily ornament; Signal","behavioral ecology; cognition; communication behavior; in situ measurement; nest structure; phenotype; signaling; territoriality; wader; wild population; animal behavior; animal communication; Antarctica; Article; breeding; Charadriiformes; Chionis minor ssp minor; cognition; machiavellianism; nonhuman; phenotype; shorebird; taxonomy; wild animal; animal; bird; nesting; pilot study; territoriality; Charadriiformes; Charadrius; Chionis minor; Animals; Antarctic Regions; Birds; Charadriiformes; Nesting Behavior; Pilot Projects; Territoriality","Amundsen, T., Fishes as models in studies of sexual selection and parental care (2003) J.

South China Sika Deer (Cervus pseudaxis), listed as a Category I Key National Protected Wild Animal Species, is only distributed in small areas in Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi Province. The Qianqingtang Area of the Qingliangfeng Nature Reserve in Zhejiang is one of the important distribution areas of the species, but the small area severely restricts its population development. Therefore, it is urgent to evaluate the habitat quality of the Qianqingtang Area and the surrounding areas to provide important implications for the species conservation and wild release. In this study, infrared cameras were used to monitor occurrences of Sika Deer in the Qianqingtang Area, and field surveys and remote sensing techniques were used to obtain eight environmental factors quantifying the terrain, vegetation, water sources and human disturbance. Maximum Entropy Model (MaxEnt) was used to construct a suitability model for Sika Deer within the 50 km × 50 km area with the Qianqingtang Area as the center. The results showed that Sika Deer preferred to choose relatively gentle areas at an altitude of 1050-1240 m, 100-900 m from the road and 3200-3800 m from the populated area. The habitat within the Qianqingtang Area was well protected, and the suitable habitat area is 2224 hm2, accounting for 39.1% of the area. Suitable habitats were also found in a mountainous area located about 10 km southwest to the Qianqingtang Area which may provide a potential suitable habitat of 3253 hm2 for the deer. To promote the population increase of Sika Deer, we suggested reduction of the human disturbance inside the Qianqingtang Area and wild release of some captive deer to the mountainous area in the southwest. © 2020 Science Press.

Aerial images, where the target may be obfuscated from the environmental conditions, angle-of-attack, and zoom level, pose a more significant challenge to correctly detect targets in. This paper describes the implementation of a regional convolutional neural network to locate and classify objects across several categories in complex, aerial images. Our current results show promise in detecting and classifying objects.

This task is traditionally performed by Biologists or other Scientists, which may demand a heavy cognitive burden and appreciable processing time searching and selecting information from thousands of pictures. Recently crowdsourcing and citizen science arose as a significant information source of potential scientific use. In particular, the use of non-professional photographs taken by the general public is being leveraged by many scientific projects. This represents an opportunity to enlarge the picture database required in trustable capture-recapture models, but at the same time human-assisted matching becomes unfeasible. Automated image analysis may represent an obvious aid, but applying image analytics to match individuals in large unfiltered datasets may be too slow and full of spurious results. Another strategy may be first to filter out useless images or parts thereof, retaining only the regions of interest (RoIs) in which appears the actual visible portion of the animal to be identified. In this work, we explore and develop a multi-criterion RoI detection for marine mammal pictures taken in the open. Particularly we focus on Commerson's dolphins pictures. Popular RoI detection algorithms, like Haar-wavelet-based methods, are show to perform poorly. For this reason, a convolutional neural network and a multifractal classifier based on color and texture features were developed, achieving significantly better outcomes. The resulting RoIs are much more robust, can be automated, and reduce the further burden of the identification process, either assisted or unassisted. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Citizen science; Image processing; Marine mammals; Object segmentation; Photo-identification","algorithm; artificial intelligence; cognition; database; identification method; image analysis; image processing; marine mammal; mark-recapture method; photograph; segmentation; wavelet analysis; Animalia; Mammalia","Araujo, G., Snow, S., So, C.L., Labaja, J., Murray, R., Colucci, A., Ponzo, A., Population structure, residency patterns and movements of whale sharks in Southern Leyte, Philippines: results from dedicated photo-ID and citizen science (2017) Aquat.

The expanding role of predictive algorithms is part of a broader movement toward using data-driven machine learning (ML) for modalities including images, natural language, speech. This article reviews whether and to what extent predictive algorithms can assist decision-making in forest conservation and management. Although state-of-the-art ML algorithms provide new opportunities, adoption has been slow in forest decision-making. This review shows how domain-specific characteristics, such as system complexity, impose limits on using predictive algorithms in forest conservation and management. We conclude with possible directions for developing new predictive tools and approaches to support meaningful forest decisions through easily interpretable and explainable recommendations. © Copyright © 2021 Rana and Varshney.","forest system complexity; forestry; limits to prediction; machine learning; trustworthy algorithms","","Adadi, A., Berrada, M., Peeking inside the black-box: a survey on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 52138-52160; Aertsen, W., Kint, V., Van Orshoven, J., Özkan, K., Muys, B., Comparison and ranking of different modelling techniques for prediction of site index in Mediterranean mountain forests (2010) Ecol.

The surgical instrument currently being used is an important parameter used to assess the instantaneous operating room status. An automated system was developed that detects unmodified surgical instruments in real time using a sensor-based table.Methods:  A multi-sensor operating room table was designed featuring a 2D camera, digital scale, and infrared camera. Software was developed to detect and record the sequence of changes on the table during a surgical procedure. The detection rates were evaluated under laboratory conditions by recording the observed instrument usage in 27 functional endoscopic sinus surgeries (FESS).Results :  The detection rate achieved using video-based detection alone was 84.9 %. The total detection rate achieved with the combined approach using both video- and weight-based information was 90.3 %.Conclusion:  A multi-sensor table-based automated instrument tracking system was developed that provides a foundation for the intra-operative detection of surgical instruments without modifying the instruments in the surgical tray. This system was tested and found to satisfy clinical FESS requirements with a reasonable accuracy. This system may also be useful to improve patient safety, for example to prevent instruments being left in the patient. © 2014, CARS.","Computer-assisted surgery; Instrument usage detection; Intra-operative monitoring; Nurse training; Surgical process model; Workflow","computer program; devices; equipment design; human; operating table; patient monitoring; surgical equipment; utilization; Equipment Design; Humans; Monitoring, Intraoperative; Operating Tables; Software; Surgical Instruments","Sutherland, J., Van den Heuvel, W., Towards an intelligent hospital environment: adaptive workflow in the OR of the future.

Green Street, Athens, GA  30602, United States","Costs associated with antipredator behaviors can have profound effects on prey populations. We investigated the effects of predation risk on white-tailed deer foraging behavior by manipulating predator distributions through exclusion while controlling for effects of habitat type. In 2003, we constructed predator exclosures on 4 of 8 approximately 40-ha study plots in southwestern Georgia, USA. We examined the seasonal and sex-specific effects of predator exclusion, and group size and composition on the behavioral state (i.e., feeding or vigilant) of foraging white-tailed deer at baited camera traps during 2011-2012. Predator exclusion resulted in a 5% increase in the time females spent feeding during the summer, concurrent with fawning; and 13.4% increase in the time males spent feeding during winter, while in postrut condition. Males were more vigilant than females and demonstrated a stronger response to predator exclusion. Males showed no response to group size or composition, whereas females and juveniles decreased foraging when males were present during the summer. Our results suggest that white-tailed deer alter vigilance levels in response to predator distributions independent of habitat cues. We propose that expanding coyote populations in the southeastern USA influence white-tailed deer numerically through predation of juveniles, and behaviorally by inducing antipredator responses that likely carry foraging costs.

The popularity of camera trapping in wildlife surveys continues to increase as they are able to detect species in remote and difficult-to-access areas. As a result, several statistical estimators of the abundance of unmarked animal populations have been developed, but none have been widely tested. Even where the potential for accurate estimation has been demonstrated, whether these methods estimators can yield estimates of sufficient precision to detect trends and inform conservation action remains questionable. Here, we assess the effort–precision relationship of camera trap distance sampling (CTDS) in order to help researchers design efficient surveys. A total of 200 cameras were deployed for 10 months across 200 km2 in the Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire. We estimated abundance of Maxwell's duikers, western chimpanzees, leopards, and forest elephants that are challenging to enumerate due to rarity or semi-arboreality. To test the effects of spatial and temporal survey effort on the precision of CTDS estimates, we calculated coefficient of variation (CV) of the encounter rate from subsets of our complete data sets. Estimated abundance of leopard and Maxwell's duiker density (20% &lt; CV &lt; 30% and CV = 11%, respectively) were similar to prior estimates from the same area. Abundances of chimpanzees (20% &lt; CV &lt; 30%) were underestimated, but the quality of inference was similar to that reported after labor-intensive line transect surveys to nests. Estimates for the rare forest elephants were potentially unreliable since they were too imprecise (60% &lt; CV &lt; 200%). Generalized linear models coefficients indicated that for relatively common, ground-dwelling species, CVs between 10% and 20% are achievable from a variety of survey designs, including long-term (6+ months) surveys at few locations (50), or short term (2-week to 2-month) surveys at 100–150 locations. We conclude that CTDS can efficiently provide estimates of abundance of multiple species of sufficient quality and precision to inform conservation decisions. However, estimates for the rarest species will be imprecise even from ambitious surveys and may be biased for species that exhibit strong reactions to cameras. © 2021 The Authors.","chimpanzee; design;

Recent advances in digital cameras and image-analysis software offer unprecedented potential for computer-automated bird detection and counts in high-resolution aerial images. We review the literature on this subject and provide an overview of the main image-analysis techniques. Birds that contrast sharply with image backgrounds (e.g., bright birds on dark ground) are generally the most amenable to automated detection, in some cases requiring only basic image-analysis software. However, the sophisticated analysis capabilities of modern object-based image analysis software provide ways to detect birds in more challenging situations based on a variety of attributes including color, size, shape, texture, and spatial context. Some techniques developed to detect mammals may also be applicable to birds, although the prevalent use of aerial thermal-infrared images for detecting large mammals is of limited applicability to birds because of the low pixel resolution of thermal cameras and the smaller size of birds. However, the increasingly high resolution of true-color cameras and availability of small unmanned aircraft systems (drones) that can fly at very low altitude now make it feasible to detect even small shorebirds in aerial images. Continued advances in camera and drone technology, in combination with increasingly sophisticated image analysis software, now make it possible for investigators involved in monitoring bird populations to save time and resources by increasing their use of automated bird detection and counts in aerial images. We recommend close collaboration between wildlife-monitoring practitioners and experts in the fields of remote sensing and computer science to help generate relevant, accessible, and readily applicable computer-automated aerial photographic census techniques. © 2016 Association of Field Ornithologists","aerial surveys; OBIA; population monitoring; survey methods; UAV; waterbirds; wildlife management","","Abd-Elrahman, A., Pearlstine, L., Percival, F., Development of pattern recognition algorithm for automatic bird detection from unmanned aerial vehicle imagery (2005) Surveying and Land Information Science, 65, pp. 37-45; Bajzak, D., Piatt, J.F., Computer-aided procedure for counting waterfowl on aerial photographs (1990) Wildlife Society Bulletin, 18, pp. 125-129; Bako, G., Tolnai, M., Takacs, A., Introduction and testing of a monitoring and colony-mapping method for waterbird populations that uses high-speed and ultra-detailed aerial remote sensing (2014) Sensors, 14, pp. 12828-12846; Barber-Meyer, S.M., Kooyman, G.L., Ponganis, P.J., Estimating the relative abundance of Emperor Penguins at inaccessible colonies using satellite imagery (2007) Polar Biology, 30, pp. 1565-1570; Béchet, A., Reed, A., Plante, N., Giroux, J.-F., Gauthier, G., Estimating the size of the Greater Snow Goose population (2004) Journal of Wildlife Management, 68, pp. 639-649; Bibby, C.J., Burgess, N.D., Hill, D.A., (1992) Bird census techniques, , Academic Press, London; Boyd, S.W., A comparison of photo counts versus visual estimates for determining the size of Snow Goose flocks (2000) Journal of Field Ornithology, 71, pp. 686-690; Buckland, S.T., Burt, M.L., Rexstad, E.A., Mellor, M., Williams, A.E., Woodward, R., Aerial surveys of seabirds: the advent of digital methods (2012) Journal of Applied Ecology, 49, pp. 960-967; Butler, M.J., Ballard, W.B., Wallace, M.C., Demaso, S.J., McGee, B.K., Aerial surveys for estimating Wild Turkey abundance in the Texas Rolling Plains (2008) Journal of Wildlife Management, 71, pp. 1639-1645; Certain, G., Bretagnolle, V., Monitoring seabirds population in marine ecosystem: the use of strip-transect aerial surveys (2008) Remote Sensing of Environment, 112, pp. 3314-3322; Chabot, D., Bird, D.M., Evaluation of an off-the-shelf unmanned aircraft system for surveying flocks of geese (2012) Waterbirds, 35, pp. 170-174; Chabot, D., Bird, D.M., Wildlife research and management methods in the 21st century: where do unmanned aircraft fit in?

Survey methods that provide estimates of these population parameters can vary greatly in effort required, area covered, precision of estimates, and cost. Trade-offs are required, because increasing precision and area coverage generally requires increasing field effort and incurs a higher cost. We compare DNA- and camera trap based-spatial capture-recapture approaches (DNA-SCR and CT-SCR) to the widely-used, dung-based line transect distance sampling (LTDS) method to assess their performance when applied to three relatively large populations of forest elephant Loxodonta cyclotis (&gt;500 individuals), in order to evaluate their feasibility for future use at national and regional scales. Six of the nine surveys had a coefficient of variation below 20%; area coverage via DNA-SCR and LTDS was comparable and greatly exceeded that of the CT-SCR as applied; overall cost was highest for the LTDS surveys compared to the other two methods. We designed a new metric with which to compare survey methods: an integrated feasibility index (IFI). This combines three typical survey components: total area covered, level of precision achieved, and cost. The IFI suggests that DNA-SCR and LTDS are equally acceptable in terms of the combination of the three survey components, and that either survey method is suitable for large (national or regional) spatial scales for forest elephant density estimation. CT-SCR provides more precise estimates, but has double the IFI, due to the high cost per km2. DNA-SCR in particular, given the improvements highlighted in this study, is now being used at a national scale in Gabon. In conclusion, we recommend that the use of these spatial capture-recapture (SCR) methods, and their development, continue. Future findings and improvements should be compiled across studies to ensure their robust evolution as an option for monitoring the African forest elephant across its range and inform strategies and action for its conservation. © 2021 The Authors","Abundance estimate; Africa; Camera trap; Density estimation; DNA; Gabon; Line transect survey; Loxodonta cyclotis; Monitoring; Non-invasive genetic sampling; Spatial capture-recapture; Survey methods","","Ahrestani, F.S., Kumar, N.S., Vaidyanathan, S., Hiby, L., Jathanna, D., Karanth, K.U., Estimating densities of large herbivores in tropical forests: rigorous evaluation of a dung‐based method (2018) Ecol.

These sensory stimuli can have a wide range of effects on animal behavior, reproductive success, and physiology. However, less is known about the functional and community-level consequences of these sensory pollutants, especially when they co-occur. Using camera traps in a manipulative field experiment, we studied the effects of anthropogenic light and noise, singularly and in tandem, on richness and community turnover at both the taxa and functional group level as well as foraging activity. We showed that both light and noise pollution did alter taxonomic richness and that these effects can differ depending on the scale of observation. Increases in light levels had a negative effect on richness at the camera-level scale, but light-treated sites had the highest pooled (i.e., cumulative) richness of all treatment types. In contrast, noise was found to have a negative effect on cumulative richness; however, when both stimuli were present, the addition of night-lighting mitigated the effects of noise. Artificial light and moonlight had the strongest influence on community turnover, and results remained consistent at both the taxa and functional group level. Additionally, increases in ambient noise and moonlight, but not artificial light, reduced foraging activity. Our study provides evidence that alterations to the sensory environment can alter the richness and composition of communities and that effects can be scale-dependent and also alter foraging behavior. Unexpectedly, the addition of artificial light may have mitigated the negative effects of noise on cumulative taxonomic richness. This highlights the importance of researching the consequences of co-exposure to these globally common pollutants. © 2021 The Authors","ALAN; light pollution; manipulative experiment; multiple stressors; noise pollution; sensory ecology","Animals; Cameras; ALAN; Anthropogenic noise; Artificial light; Effect of noise; Group level; Light pollution; Manipulative experiment; Multiple stressors; Sensory ecologies; Taxonomic richness; Noise pollution; anthropogenic source; behavioral response; community structure; foraging behavior; light effect; light pollution; noise pollution; pollution effect; pollution exposure; vertebrate; animal experiment; anthropogenic noise; Aphelocoma woodhouseii; Article; artificial night light; bird; community structure; controlled study; exposure; foraging; light; light pollution; Meleagris gallopavo; moonlight; noise; noise pollution; nonhuman; Peromyscus; species composition; species richness; taxonomy; Urocyon cinereoargenteus; vertebrate; adverse event; animal; animal behavior; human; illumination; light; reproduction; vertebrate; Vertebrata; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Humans; Light; Lighting; Noise; Reproduction; Vertebrates","Amichai, E., Kronfeld-Schor, N., Artificial light at night promotes activity throughout the night in nesting common swifts (Apus apus) (2019) Sci.

Using the deep learning model to automatically identify the empty camera trap images can reduce the workload of manual classification significantly. However, the performance of deep learning models is easily affected by the class imbalance problem of training datasets, which is a common problem for actual wildlife survey projects. Almost all previous studies on empty image recognition used down-sampling or oversampling methods to eliminate the effect of class imbalance on the performance of deep learning classifiers. The class imbalance problem has been systematically studied in the field of traditional image recognition, yet very limited research is available in the context of identifying camera trap images taken from highly cluttered natural scenes. This study systematically studied the impact of class imbalance on model performance when using a deep learning model to identify empty camera trap images. Then we proposed the construction method of training sets of the deep learning model when the data set has different class imbalance levels. Based on results from our experiments we concluded that (i) the class imbalance showed little effect on the performance of the model when the empty image ratio (EIR) in the data set was between 10% and 70%, so the training sets can be randomly built without changing the class distribution; (ii) we recommended using oversampling to partially eliminate class imbalance to reduce omission errors when the EIR of the data set exceeded 70%; (iii) when the EIRs of the training set and the test set were close, the overall error, omission error, and commission error of the model were relatively smaller, and the model tended to achieve a better overall performance; (iv) the omission and commission errors can be adjusted by changing the percentage of empty images in the training set. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Camera trap images; Class imbalance; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Image classification","algorithm; artificial neural network; construction method; detection method; image analysis; image classification","Bennin, K.E., Keung, J., Phannachitta, P., Monden, A., Mensah, S., [journal first] MAHAKIL: Diversity based oversampling approach to alleviate the class imbalance issue in software defect prediction (2018) 2018 IEEE/ACM 40th international conference on software engineering (ICSE), p. 699. , Presented at the 2018 IEEE/ACM 40th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE); Buda, M., Maki, A., Mazurowski, M.A., A systematic study of the class imbalance problem in convolutional neural networks (2018) Neural Netw., 106, pp. 249-259; Chang, J., Chen, Y., Batch-normalized Maxout Network in Network (2015) arXiv. arXiv:1511.02583; Chawla, N.V., Data mining for imbalanced datasets: an overview (2010) Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Handbook, pp. 875-886. , O.

For the majority of Felidae species, individuals are identifiable from camera trap images because of their unique coat patterns; therefore, camera trapping is used extensively for felids to build individual capture histories. For those species not individually identifiable, one can be tempted to use trap success rate as a relative abundance index (RAI) to inform conservation and management decisions, although robust scientific approach can be used for this scenario. Indeed, recent studies have shown that RAIs can be biased by species-specific behaviour, camera trap deployment and by the body size of the species. Here, we investigate how camera trap rates (henceforth RAIs) vary between species within the Felidae and whether these RAIs are related to body mass or camera-trapping approach (whether the species is targeted or not) accounting for likely confounding factors such as trapping effort, inter-trap distance and number of deployed cameras. We explored all the literature available from primary scientific databases dealing with camera trap studies in Felidae. The literature search resulted in 179 studies from which 513 records for 30 felid species from 53 countries were obtained. Across species, the number of detections (accounting for trapping effort) was positively related to species log-body mass and to the targeting of species in the survey. Hence, comparing RAIs across species of different body size and within species with different camera-trapping approaches might be misleading. Accounting for variability in species body mass is of primary importance when designing multi-species camera trap survey, and in the subsequent analysis of data, in addition to conducting trials to test for species-specific camera-trapping responses. © 2015 The Zoological Society of London.","Bias; Body size; Camera trapping; Confounding factors; Felids; Relative abundance index; Targeted species; Trapping success","body mass; conservation management; felid; identification method; imaging method; population density; relative abundance; species conservation; trapping; wild population; Felidae; Mammalia","Anderson, D., In my opinion (2001) Wildl.

Cameras easily identified brushtail possums, hedgehogs, ship rats, wild house mice, and mustelids, i.e., stoats, feral ferrets and weasels taken as a group. The data comprise four sets of estimates, one set of 15 (five targets, three habitats) for each season of the year, total of 60. Of these, only 10 (17%) returned probabilities of detection of more than 50% for that species in that habitat at that season, given that at least one individual was present then. All pest species we monitored were present on pastoral land. Pasture makes up more than half of the land cover of the Waikato, so it supports large numbers even of species that are not abundant in that habitat. Hence, pest control operations intended to conserve indigenous species in protected forests need to allow for the important effects of rapid reinvasions of controlled areas from adjacent pasture. © 2021 The Royal Society of New Zealand.","camera traps; detection failure; distribution surveys; Pest management; site-occupancy analyses","biological control; crop pest; detection method; land cover; mustelid; pest control; pest species; New Zealand; North Island; Waikato","Anton, V., Hartley, S., Wittmer, H.U., Evaluation of remote cameras for monitoring multiple invasive mammals in New Zealand (2018) New Zealand Journal of Ecology, 42 (1), pp. 74-79; (2009) Economic costs of pests to New Zealand, , Wellington: MAF Biosecurity New Zealand; Breedt, B., (2017), Mammalian pests the Waikato Region: A site-occupancy analysis of main habitats.

Identification of individuals is necessary to make unbiased estimates of population parameters, and can allow for the generation of more robust inferences from studies of spatial and behavioral ecology. Here we tested the utility of an approach to individually identify wild giant pandas Ailuropoda melanoleuca from camera trap images, by cataloguing and careful scrutiny of numerous traits. We developed our identification strategy first by analyzing images of known (captive) individuals (N = 7). We then deployed camera traps at 23 control sites and at seven camera trap arrays ‘baited’ with conspecific decoys, in Foping Nature Reserve, China. From a sample of 12 871 photographs, and using the method we developed with known individuals, we were able to identify 11 individual giant pandas. We tested the repeatability of this approach using a double blind test with 12 naïve volunteers, achieving a relatively high inter-observer agreement of 80%, which was increased to 93% when observers reported a high degree of confidence. We also found that image quality was significantly higher at decoy sites than at control sites. We suggest that this approach will be useful for future field projects, allowing researchers to address a broader array of questions and provide new insights into panda ecology and conservation. © 2016 The Zoological Society of London","Ailuropoda melanoleuca; camera traps; decoy; giant panda; image analysis; individual identification; visual identification","analytical hierarchy process; bear; behavioral ecology; conservation management; conservation status; conspecific; identification method; image analysis; photograph; population estimation; videography; China; Foping Nature Reserve; Shaanxi; Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Animalia","Anderson, C.J.R., Roth, J.D., Waterman, J.M., Can whisker spot patterns be used to identify individual polar bears?

Remote cameras have great but as yet unrealized potential to uncover patterns arising from predatory, competitive or other interactions that structure animal communities by detecting species that are active at the same sites and recording their behaviours and times of activity. Here, we use multi-season, two-species occupancy models to test for evidence of interactions between introduced (feral cat Felis catus) and native predator (Tasmanian devil Sarcophilus harrisii) and predator and small mammal (swamp rat Rattus lutreolus velutinus) combinations at baited camera sites in the cool temperate forests of southern Tasmania. In addition, we investigate the capture rates of swamp rats in traps scented with feral cat and devil faecal odours. We observed that one species could reduce the probability of detecting another at a camera site. In particular, feral cats were detected less frequently at camera sites occupied by devils, whereas patterns of swamp rat detection associated with devils or feral cats varied with study site. Captures of swamp rats were not associated with odours on traps, although fewer captures tended to occur in traps scented with the faecal odour of feral cats. The observation that a native carnivorous marsupial, the Tasmanian devil, can suppress the detectability of an introduced eutherian predator, the feral cat, is consistent with a dominant predator - mesopredator relationship. Such a relationship has important implications for the interaction between feral cats and the lower trophic guilds that form their prey, especially if cat activity increases in places where devil populations are declining. More generally, population estimates derived from devices such as remote cameras need to acknowledge the potential for one species to change the detectability of another, and incorporate this in assessments of numbers and survival. © 2013 Lazenby, Dickman.","","article; Australia; controlled study; introduced species; native species; nonhuman; predator prey interaction; prey selection; seasonal variation; species comparison; species distribution; species habitat; species identification; temperate deciduous forest; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Cats; Ecosystem; Predatory Behavior; Rats; Seasons; Tasmania; Animalia; Eutheria; Felis catus; Mammalia; Metatheria; Rattus lutreolus; Sarcophilus harrisii; Scapteromys tumidus","Elton, C.S., (1967) Animal ecology, , Great Britain: William Clowes and Sons Ltd; Wootton, J.T., Emmerson, M., Measurement of interaction strength in nature (2005) Ann Rev Ecol Evol S, 36, pp. 419-444; Ritchie, E.G., Martin, J.K., Johnson, C.N., Fox, B.J., Separating the influences of environment and species interactions on patterns of distribution and abundance: competition between large herbivores (2009) J Anim Ecol, 78, pp. 724-731; Apfelbach, R., Blanchard, C.D., Blanchard, R.J., Hayes, R.A., McGregor, I.S., The effects of predator odors in mammalian prey species: a review of field and laboratory studies (2005) Neurosci Biobehav Rev, 29, pp. 1123-1144; Grether, G.F., Losin, N., Anderson, C.N., Okamoto, K., The role of interspecific interference competition in character displacement and the evolution of competitor recognition (2009) Biol Rev, 84, pp. 617-635; Nersesian, C.L., Banks, P.B., McArthur, C., Behavioural responses to indirect and direct predator cues by a mammalian herbivore, the common brushtail possum (2012) Behav Ecol Sociobiol, 66, pp. 44-55; Cutler, T.L., Swann, D.E., Using remote photography in wildlife ecology: a review (1999) Wildlife Soc Bull, 27, pp. 571-581; MacKenzie, D.I., Bailey, L.L., Nichols, J.D., Investigating species co-occurrence patterns when species are detected imperfectly (2004) J Anim Ecol, 73, pp. 546-555; Dickman, C.R., Mechanisms of competition among insectivorous mammals (1991) Oecologia, 85, pp. 464-471; Letnic, M., Ritchie, E.G., Dickman, C.R., Top predators as biodiversity regulators: the dingo Canis lupus dingo as a case study (2012) Biol Rev, 87, pp. 390-413; Ripple, W.J., Beschta, R.L., Wolves and the ecology of fear: can predation risk structure ecosystems?

Of particular importance are risks to firefighters and operational forces, which highlights the need for leveraging technology to minimize danger to people and property. FLAME (Fire Luminosity Airborne-based Machine learning Evaluation) offers a dataset of aerial images of fires along with methods for fire detection and segmentation which can help firefighters and researchers to develop optimal fire management strategies. This paper provides a fire image dataset collected by drones during a prescribed burning piled detritus in an Arizona pine forest. The dataset includes video recordings and thermal heatmaps captured by infrared cameras. The captured videos and images are annotated, and labeled frame-wise to help researchers easily apply their fire detection and modeling algorithms. The paper also highlights solutions to two machine learning problems: (1) Binary classification of video frames based on the presence [and absence] of fire flames. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method is developed that achieved a 76% classification accuracy. (2) Fire detection using segmentation methods to precisely determine fire borders. A deep learning method is designed based on the U-Net up-sampling and down-sampling approach to extract a fire mask from the video frames. Our FLAME method approached a precision of 92%, and recall of 84%. Future research will expand the technique for free burning broadcast fire using thermal images. © 2021 The Authors","Aerial imaging; Deep learning; Fire detection and segmentation; Fire monitoring dataset","Aerial photography; Deep learning; Disasters; Fires; Forestry; Image segmentation; Neural networks; Piles; Signal sampling; Video recording; Aerial imagery; Aerial imaging; Deep learning; Fire detection; Fire monitoring dataset; Fire segmentations; Learning evaluations; Machine-learning; Natural disasters; Video frame; Antennas","National interagency fire center (2020), https://www.nifc.gov/fireInfo/nfn.htm, (Accessed on 28 october 2020); National interagency fire center (2020), https://www.nifc.gov/fireInfo/fireInfo_statistics.html, (Accessed on 28 october 2020); Toledo-Castro, J., Caballero-Gil, P., Rodríguez-Pérez, N., Santos-González, I., Hernández-Goya, C., Aguasca-Colomo, R., Forest fire prevention, detection, and fighting based on fuzzy logic and wireless sensor networks (2018) Complexity, 2018, pp. 1-17; Kaur, H., Sood, S.K., Fog-assisted IoT-enabled scalable network infrastructure for wildfire surveillance (2019) J.

Unmanned aircraft systems (UASs), with advantages in safety, convenience and inexpensiveness, have been increasingly used in wild animal surveys. However, manually reviewing wild animals from thousands of images generated by UASs is tedious and inefficient. To support wild animal detection in UAS images, researchers have developed various automatic and semiautomatic algorithms. Among these algorithms, deep learning techniques achieve outstanding performances in wild animal detection, but have some practical issues (e.g., limited animal pixels and sparse animal samples). Based on a typical deep learning pipeline, faster region based convolutional neural networks (Faster R-CNN), this study adopted several tactics, including feature stride shortening, anchor size optimization, and hard negative class, to overcome the practical issues in wild animal detection in UAS images. In this study, a kiang survey was conducted in UAS datasets (23,748 images) obtained by 14 flight campaigns in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. The validation experiments of our adopted tactics revealed the following: (1) feature stride shortening and anchor size optimization improved small animal detection performance in the animal patch set, increasing the F1 score from 0.84 to 0.86 and from 0.86 to 0.92, respectively; and (2) the hard negative class significantly suppressed false positives in the full UAS image set, increasing the F1 score from 0.44 to 0.86. The test results in the full UAS image set showed that the modified model with the adopted tactics can be applied to either a semiautomatic survey to accelerate manual verification by 25 times or an automatic survey with an F1 score of approximately 0.90. This study demonstrates that the combination of UAS and deep learning techniques can enable automatic/semiautomatic, accurate, inexpensive, and efficient wild animal surveys. © 2020","Deep learning; Object detection; Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS); Wild animal survey","Animals; Convolutional neural networks; Feature extraction; Image enhancement; Learning systems; Surveys; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Automatic surveys; Detection performance; Eastern Tibetan plateau; Ecosystem management; Learning techniques; Semi-automatic algorithms; Size optimization; Unmanned aircraft system; Deep learning; airborne survey; algorithm; artificial neural network; detection method; machine learning; pixel; satellite imagery; survey method; unmanned vehicle; wild population; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Animalia; Equus kiang","Anderson, K., Gaston, K.J., Lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles will revolutionize spatial ecology (2013) Front.

Such methods are well-established, but often make data collection and analyses time-consuming, or limit the contexts in which data can be collected. Recent computational advances, specifically deep learning, can help overcome the limitations of collecting large-scale data across contexts. However, one of the bottlenecks preventing the application of deep learning for individual identification is the need to collect and identify hundreds to thousands of individually labelled pictures to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Here we describe procedures for automating the collection of training data, generating training datasets, and training CNNs to allow identification of individual birds. We apply our procedures to three small bird species, the sociable weaver Philetairus socius, the great tit Parus major and the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata, representing both wild and captive contexts. We first show how the collection of individually labelled images can be automated, allowing the construction of training datasets consisting of hundreds of images per individual. Second, we describe how to train a CNN to uniquely re-identify each individual in new images. Third, we illustrate the general applicability of CNNs for studies in animal biology by showing that trained CNNs can re-identify individual birds in images collected in contexts that differ from the ones originally used to train the CNNs. Finally, we present a potential solution to solve the issues of new incoming individuals. Overall, our work demonstrates the feasibility of applying state-of-the-art deep learning tools for individual identification of birds, both in the laboratory and in the wild. These techniques are made possible by our approaches that allow efficient collection of training data. The ability to conduct individual recognition of birds without requiring external markers that can be visually identified by human observers represents a major advance over current methods. © 2020 The Authors.

Dynamic environmental conditions and dense vegetative cover, both of which are attributes of biodiverse wet meadow ecosystems, further hamper field surveys. Camera traps may be a solution, but commonly used passive infrared game cameras face difficulties photographing herpetofauna and small mammals. The adapted-Hunt drift fence technique (AHDriFT) is a camera trap and drift fence system designed to overcome traditional limitations, but has not been extensively evaluated. We deployed 15 Y-shaped AHDriFT arrays (three cameras per array) in northern Ohio wet meadows from March 10 to October 5, 2019. Equipment for each array cost approximately US$1,570. Construction and deployment of each array took approximately 3 h, with field servicing requiring 15 min per array. Arrays proved durable under wind, ice, snow, flooding, and heat. Processing 2 wk of images of 45 cameras averaged about 13 person-hours. We obtained 9,018 unique-capture events of 41 vertebrate species comprised of 5 amphibians, 13 reptiles (11 snakes), 16 mammals, and 7 birds. We imaged differing animal size classes ranging from invertebrates to weasels. We assessed detection efficacy by using expected biodiversity baselines. We determined snake communities from 3 y of traditional surveys and possible small mammal and amphibian biodiversity from prior observations and species ranges and habitat requirements. We cumulatively detected all amphibians and 92% of snakes and small mammals that we expected to be present. We also imaged four mammal and two snake species where they were not previously observed. However, capture consistency was variable by taxa and species, and low-mobility species or species in low densities may not be detected. In its current design, AHDriFT proved to be effective for terrestrial vertebrate biodiversity surveying. © 2021 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

One such example is in provisioning behavior. Parents of altricial species are selected to provide parental care (such as food provisioning) for their offspring, but there is substantial variation in the level of this care. Provisioning rate may be determined environmentally, by the physiological ability of parents and needs of nestlings, or by evolutionary incentives. We quantified provisioning rate in 20 purple martin Progne subis nests in the context of an experimental reduction of nest ectoparasites. 10 nests had a parasite reduction treatment, and 10 nests were controls. By using AI to automate the analysis of nest camera videos we were able to obtain nearly-continuous provisioning rate information at a high temporal resolution for the first half of the nestling period. We used random forest modeling to assess the factors determining provisioning rate and found evidence for environmental, evolutionary and physiological constraints and incentives on provisioning. Birds appeared to be environmentally limited in their provisioning in cool, wet conditions, especially later in the breeding season; but adjusted their provisioning according to the changing physiological needs of nestlings. We found evidence for a compensatory response to increased parasite load, in which parents increased provisioning to more heavily parasitized nests. © 2020 Nordic Society Oikos.

Capture-mark-reencounter (CMR) methods using marked animals are a standard approach, particularly in recent history with the development of innovative methods of marking using camera traps or DNA samples. However, estimates of abundance from multiple encounters of marked individuals are biased low when individual heterogeneity of encounter probabilities is not accounted for in the estimator. We evaluated the operating characteristics of the Huggins logit-normal estimator through computer simulations, using Gaussian–Hermite quadrature to model individual encounter heterogeneity. We simulated individual encounter data following a factorial design with 2 levels of sampling occasions (t = 5, 10), 3 levels of abundance (N = 100, 500, 1,000), 4 levels of median detection probabilities (p = 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6) for each sampling occasion (on the probability scale), and 4 levels of individual heterogeneity (σp = 0, 0.5, 1, 2; on the logit normal scale), resulting in a design space consisting of 96 simulation scenarios (2 × 3 × 4 × 4). For each scenario, we performed 1,000 simulations using the Huggins estimators Mt, M0, Mt RE, and M0RE, where the RE subscript corresponds to the random effects model. As expected, the Mt and M0 estimators were biased when individual heterogeneity was present but unbiased for σp = 0 data. The estimators for Mt RE and M0RE were biased high for N = 100 and median p ≤ 0.2 but showed little bias elsewhere. The bias is attributed to the occasional sets of data that result in a low overall detection probability and a resulting highly skewed sampling distribution of (Formula presented). This result is confirmed in that the median of the sampling distributions was only slightly biased high. The random effects estimators performed poorly for σp = 0 data, mainly because a log link function forces the estimate of σp &gt; 0. However, the Fletcher ĉ statistic provided useful evidence to evaluate σp &gt; 0, as did likelihood ratio tests of the null hypothesis σp = 0.

We investigated how immature wild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes troglodytes, acquired the technique for extracting underground honey. This technique is interesting because (1) adults perform exploration, pounding and perforation in nonrandom but highly flexible action sequences to locate underground bee nests, (2) they have individual preferences for how to perforate the ground and (3) the nests are deeply buried and concealed, making success difficult to achieve. We analysed the behaviour of 16 immatures recorded by camera traps at 50 sites, and tested the influence of individual attributes (namely, age and sex) and maternal behaviour; we also tested whether mothers provided learning opportunities for their offspring. We found that, as they aged, immatures of both sexes progressively matched adults’ behaviour in action sequences and observed their social models more continuously. Immature males used the most common grip type used by adults for perforating (namely, the coordinated use of hands and feet) progressively more as they aged, but no effect of maternal preferences was detected. Thus, the adult technique was probably acquired via a combination of physical maturation (i.e. increased body strength and motor coordination) and observational learning, although individual learning could not be completely ruled out. Finally, the proportion of time mothers spent inactive at bee nest sites was high when they were accompanied by young daughters and decreased as daughters aged, while the opposite pattern was found for sons. Mothers may thus stimulate learning by immatures by adjusting their behaviour according to their offspring's sex and age. Overall, we showed that immature chimpanzees acquired this complex tool use behaviour via a combination of social and nonsocial learning processes, including potential maternal stimulation. © 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","honey extraction; learning; ontogeny; Pan troglodytes troglodytes; stimulation; stingless bees; teaching; tool use","bee; ecological modeling; extraction method; learning; maturation; ontogeny; preference behavior; primate; social behavior; teaching; tool use; Gabon; Gabon; Loango National Park; Ogooue Maritime; Animalia; Apoidea; Meliponinae; Pan; Pan troglodytes troglodytes","Baayen, R.H., Analyzing linguistic data: a practical introduction to statistics using R (2008), Cambridge University Press Cambridge, U.K; Barr, D.J., Levy, R., Scheepers, C., Tily, H.J., Random effects structure for confirmatory hypothesis testing: Keep it maximal (2013) Journal of Memory and Language, 68 (3), pp. 255-278; Bates, L.A., Byrne, R.W., Sex differences in the movement patterns of free-ranging chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii): Foraging and border checking (2009) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 64 (2), pp. 247-255; Bates, D., Maechler, M., Bolker, B., Walker, S., Fitting linear mixed-effects models using lme4 (2015) Journal of Statistical Software, 67 (1), pp. 1-48; Biro, D., Sousa, C., Matsuzawa, T., Ontogeny and cultural propagation of tool use by wild chimpanzees at Bossou, Guinea: Case studies in nut cracking and leaf folding (2006) Cognitive development in chimpanzees, pp. 476-508. , T.

We used remote cameras baited with wild pig (Sus scrofa) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) carcasses to detect, age, and individually identify Golden Eagles on the U.S. Department of Energy's Savannah River Site on the coastal plain of South Carolina. We identified eight individual Golden Eagles during the winters of 2013-2014 and 2014-2015, with one detected during both winters. We detected eagles for 19 and 66 calendar days during the winters of 2013-2014 and 2014-2015, respectively, with two adult eagles detected for 30 and 31 calendar days in 2014-2015. Eagles typically scavenged on carcasses for a few days, left, and then returned when cameras were baited with another carcass, suggesting they had remained in the area. These observations suggest that large tracts of forests on the coastal plain may be important wintering areas for some Golden Eagles and, further, that other areas in the coastal plain of the southeastern United States may also harbor wintering eagles. Identification of wintering areas of Golden Eagles in the east will be an important step in the conservation of this protected species, and camera traps baited with carcasses can be an effective tool for such work. © 2015 Association of Field Ornithologists.","Aquila chrysaetos; Camera trap; Carcass; Open pine forest; Southeast; Wild pig","","Bloom, P.H., Clark, W.S., Molt and sequence of plumages of Golden Eagles and a technique for in-hand ageing (2001) North American Bird Bander, 26, pp. 97-116; Burleigh, T.D., (1958) Georgia birds, , University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, OK; Campbell, T.A., Long, D.B., Feral pig damage and damage management in forested ecosystems (2009) Forest Ecology and Management, 257, pp. 2319-2326; Dennhardt, A.J., Duerr, A.E., Brandes, D., Katzner, T.E., Integrating citizen-science data with movement models to estimate the size of a migratory Golden Eagle population (2015) Biological Conservation, 184, pp. 68-78; Duerr, A.E., Miller, T.A., Cornell Duerr, K.L., Lanzone, M.J., Fesnock, A., Katzner, T.E., Landscape-scale distribution and density of raptor populations wintering in anthropogenic-dominated desert landscapes (2015), 24, pp. 2365-2381. , Biodiversity and Conservation; Ellis, D.H., Kéry, M., Variable retention times for rectrices at different loci in a Golden Eagle (2004) Journal of Raptor Research, 38, pp. 270-275; Gregory, M.J.P., Gordon, A.G., Moss, R., Impact of nest-trapping and radio-tagging on breeding Golden Eagles Aquila chrysaetos in Argyll (2003), 145, pp. 113-119. , Scotland.

Pine Knoll, Flagstaff, AZ, United States","Habitat loss and fragmentation are major threats to global biodiversity. Felids, among the many taxa experiencing population declines and range contraction around the world, are known as ecologically and politically powerful levers in conservation programs. Many felids are wide-ranging, and therefore, identifying and conserving their core habitat patches and corridors is essential for developing an umbrella strategy for protecting co-existing species. We employed a multi-scale, multi-species approach to model habitat suitability and connectivity for six felids across Iran. We identified potential core habitats and corridors of movement. We also quantified the spatial niche overlap to estimate the most important variables of habitat selection within the guild. We evaluated the effectiveness of conservation areas in conserving habitats and connectivity. Our findings revealed that each species' habitat use was influenced in a scale-dependent manner by different sets of environmental variables. Core habitats of felids were mostly located in conservation areas. We identified a number of small core habitats for most felids outside conservation areas. Maintaining corridors and stepping stone habitat patches along corridors may be needed to facilitate movement of individuals, especially between habitat remnants in unprotected areas. Our study highlights the importance of considering multiple spatial scales in management and conservation of carnivores. Our analysis shows that habitat selection and connectivity predictions are both very sensitive to scale, and incorrect scale of analysis can result in incorrect inferences that may lead to dramatically inefficient or ineffective conservation actions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Corridor; Ecological niche model; Iran; Machine learning; Protected area; Random forest","action plan; connectivity; conservation planning; habitat selection; habitat use; machine learning; protected area; Iran; Felidae","Ahmadi, M., Nezami Balouchi, B., Jowkar, H., Hemami, M.R., Fadakar, D., Malakouti-Khah, S., Ostrowski, S., Combining landscape suitability and habitat connectivity to conserve the last surviving population of cheetah in Asia (2017) Divers.

In the past, research on animal behaviour has been benefitting from contributions of citizen scientists mainly in the field of ornithology but the full potential of CS in ecological and behavioural sciences is surely still untapped. Here, we present case studies that successfully applied CS to research projects in wildlife biology and discuss potentials and challenges experienced. Our case studies cover a broad range of opportunities: large-scale CS projects with interactive online tools on bird song dialects, engagement of stakeholders as citizen scientists to reduce human–wildlife conflicts, involvement of students of primary and secondary schools in CS projects as well as collaboration with the media leading to successful recruitment of citizen scientists. Each case study provides a short overview of the scientific questions and how they were approached to showcase the potentials and challenges of CS in wildlife biology. Based on the experience of the case studies, we highlight how CS may support research in wildlife biology and emphasise the value of fostering communication in CS to improve recruitment of participants and to facilitate learning and mutual trust among different groups of interest (e.g., researchers, stakeholders, students). We further show how specific training for the participants may be needed to obtain reliable data. We consider CS as a suitable tool to enhance research in wildlife biology through the application of open science procedures (i.e., open access to articles and the data on publicly available repositories) to support transparency and sharing experiences. © 2018 The Authors.

However, acquisition of such data, especially in large vertebrates, is a challenging and limiting aspect in many studies due to associated capture and handling. Ultimately, this prevents testing important hypotheses in wildlife ecology. We demonstrate how to overcome some of these challenges by improving the far-reaching potential of photogrammetry for wildlife. We validate a methodology using photogrammetry to acquire measurements of complex, curvilinear, morphometric traits (deer antlers) at long range (up to 200 m), providing a methodological foundation for further application to numerous physical attributes and species. We calibrated and validated two different photogrammetric camera systems and applied long-range photogrammetry to measure a suite of antler features from deer trophies positioned analogous to free-living, wild deer. We also developed, validated and described an efficient correction protocol to overcome the complexity of three-dimensional antler features. This complexity previously biased the acquisition of absolute measurements. Our measurement estimates were characterized by mean errors lower than 5% when compared to true sizes, with our correction protocol for antlers particularly effective and validated with independent antler sizes. Importantly, the estimated size rankings based on the true sizes were identical to the rankings estimated by photogrammetry in all cases. We measured antlers in free-living, wild fallow deer as a field validation and demonstration, showing how we were able to collect physical trait measurements of 230 antlers without capture. This non-invasive, remote and fast technique can provide valuable and accurate data allowing researchers to address new hypotheses by linking life-history traits to wildlife ecology, behaviour and management. © 2020 Zoological Society of London","bias correction; morphometrics; non-invasive; photogrammetry; secondary sexual traits; wildlife monitoring","deer; life history trait; photogrammetry; remote sensing; vertebrate; wild population; Dama dama; Vertebrata","Antognini, J.F., Eisele, P.H., Gronert, G.A., Evaluation for malignant hyperthermia susceptibility in black-tailed deer (1996) J.

In this study, with an intensive survey effort of 28 256 camera days at 98 locations (45 grids), we collected 8 208 independent photographs and identified 18 wild mammal species belonging to 12 families and 5 orders, 38 wild bird species belonging to 16 families and 7 orders, and 5 domestic animal species. The five most detected species were Muntiacus reevesi (CR=11.15), Lophura nycthemera (CR=2.63), M. crinifrons(CR=1.03), Sus scrofa (CR=0.96) and Macaca mulatta (CR=0.59). Among the detected species, 2 are listed as Class I state key protected wild animals in China and 6 as class II. Two species were evaluated as Endangered by the Red List of China's Vertebrates, 4 as Vulnerable and 9 as Near Threatened. Fifteen species such as Tamiops maritimus, Arborophila gingica and Scolopax rusticola, were the first to be recorded in the Fengyang Mountain, and Macropygia unchall was the first recorded in Zhejiang Province. We also found evidence of intensive human activities in the reserve, which may have potential impacts on wildlife. Our results provided a comprehensive baseline of the wildlife resources in the Fengyang Mountain for biodiversity management and long-term monitoring of the reserve. © 2018, Science Press.

Identifying nest predators is crucial for understanding the ecological context of nest predation and habitat management. The mountains of Southwest China harbors numerous species in the Phasianidae family, many of them endemic or threatened, however, little is known on the nest predation pressure on these ground breeders. We placed 32 artificial nests (each containing two chicken eggs) in broadleaf montane forests with different vegetation structure, and monitored predators with infrared-triggered cameras. The artificial nests were resembling nests of Golden Pheasant Chrysolophus pictus, a representative of the threatened species inhabiting montane broadleaf forest. We analyzed how environmental factors impact survival of artificial nests using Cox proportional hazards regression. With a failure rate of 62.5%, we recorded 40 predations where eggs were preyed or moved away, 19 predation attempts where animals spotted and contacted with, but failed to prey on or move away the eggs, and 109 pass-by events. Corvids, especially Large-billed Crow Corvus macrorhynchos was the primary culprit, committing all but one predations on artificial nests. Other potential predators included Père David's Rock Squirrel Sciurotamias davidianus, Eurasian Jay Garrulus glandarius, Red-billed Blue Magpie Urocissa erythrorhyncha, Chinese Porcupine Hystrix hodgsoni and muridaes. We found that understory cover and vertical openness were the determining factors on survival of artificial nests. Presence of understory cover and low vertical openness significantly increased survival time of artificial nests. We didn't detect significant effects from horizontal openness and distance to nearest patrol trail. Further studies with real nests are however required to examine these conclusions, and to explore reproduction strategies of ground nesting pheasants coping with threats from avian predators. © 2019 Polish Academy of Sciences.

Yet, it is largely unknown if co-occurrences of large mammals result from random processes or social preferences and if interspecific associations are consistent across ecosystems and seasons. Because species may exchange important information and services, understanding patterns and drivers of heterospecific interactions is crucial for advancing animal and community ecology. We recorded 5403 single and multi-species clusters in the Serengeti-Ngorongoro and Tarangire-Manyara ecosystems during dry and wet seasons and used social network analyses to detect patterns of species associations. We found statistically significant associations between multiple species and association patterns differed spatially and seasonally. Consistently, wildebeest and zebras preferred being associated with other species, whereas carnivores, African elephants, Maasai giraffes and Kirk's dik-diks avoided being in mixed groups. During the dry season, we found that the betweenness (a measure of importance in the flow of information or disease) of species did not differ from a random expectation based on species abundance. In contrast, in the wet season, we found that these patterns were not simply explained by variations in abundances, suggesting that heterospecific associations were actively formed. These seasonal differences in observed patterns suggest that interspecific associations may be driven by resource overlap when resources are limited and by resource partitioning or anti-predator advantages when resources are abundant. We discuss potential mechanisms that could drive seasonal variation in the cost-benefit tradeoffs that underpin the formation of mixed-species groups.

Yet, we are losing species at an unprecedented rate, and this especially occurs in tropical rainforests, the biologically richest but most eroded biome on earth. Unfortunately, there is a chronic gap in standardized and pan-tropical data in tropical forests, affecting our capacity to monitor changes and anticipate future scenarios. The Tropical Ecology, Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM) Network was established to contribute addressing this issue, as it generates real time data to monitor long-term trends in tropical biodiversity and guide conservation practice. We present the Network and focus primarily on the Terrestrial Vertebrates protocol, that uses systematic camera trapping to detect forest mammals and birds, and secondarily on the Zone of Interaction protocol, that measures changes in the anthroposphere around the core monitoring area. With over 3 million images so far recorded, and managed using advanced information technology, TEAM has created the most important data set on tropical forest mammals globally. We provide examples of site-specific and global analyses that, combined with data on anthropogenic disturbance collected in the larger ecosystem where monitoring sites are, allowed us to understand the drivers of changes of target species and communities in space and time. We discuss the potential of this system as a candidate model towards setting up an early warning system that can effectively anticipate changes in coupled human-natural system, trigger management actions, and hence decrease the gap between research and management responses. In turn, TEAM produces robust biodiversity indicators that meet the requirements set by global policies such as the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. Standardization in data collection and public sharing of data in near real time are essential features of such system. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity; Camera trapping; Ground-dwelling vertebrates; Human impact; Monitoring; Tropical forests","Alarm systems; Biodiversity; Cameras; Ecology; Forestry; Mammals; Monitoring; Anthropogenic disturbance; Assessment and monitoring; Biodiversity indicators; Coupled human-natural systems; Ground-dwelling vertebrates; Human impact; Inter-action protocols; Tropical forest; Tropics; biodiversity; early warning system; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; future prospect; human activity; mammal; rainforest; real time; tropical forest; tropical region; animal trapping; Article; bird; camera; conservation biology; environmental management; environmental monitoring; human activities; information technology; mammal; prediction; priority journal; terrestrial species; tropical rain forest; animal; biodiversity; ecology; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; procedures; rain forest; tree; tropic climate; Aves; Mammalia; Vertebrata; Animals; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecology; Environmental Monitoring; Rainforest; Trees; Tropical Climate","Ahumada, J.A., Silva, C.E.F., Gajapersad, K., Hallam, C., Hurtado, J., Martin, E., Community structure and diversity of tropical forest mammals: data from a global camera trap network (2011) Philos.

Here, we tested a UAV with red, green, and blue (RGB) and thermal cameras to detect free-living birds in a high Arctic region in North Greenland and in a restricted area in the Republic of Korea. Small flocks of molting pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus) near sea ice and incubating common ringed plovers (Charadrius hiaticula) in the Arctic environment were chosen for the RGB and thermal image studies. From the acquired images, we built mosaicked RGB images and coregistered thermal images, and estimated the animal shapes. Our results showed that geese were discriminated in both RGB and thermal images with water and sea ice backgrounds. Incubating plover bodies were not distinguished in RGB images due to their cryptic coloration, but they were detected in thermal images with cold background areas in the Arctic environment. We further conducted a blind survey in a restricted area under military control in Korea near the breeding sites of black-faced spoonbill (Platalea minor), which is an endangered species. From UAV flights with RGB and thermal cameras operated out of the restricted area, we acquired images of white objects in the mudflats and verified that the objects were resting spoonbills by watching the birds. We suggest that thermal cameras and UAVs can be applied to monitor animals in extreme environments and in restricted areas and help researchers find cryptic wader nests. © 2019 Lee et al.

Yet, insects' parasites can impact the fitness and activity of the bees. Since their activity is critical to the repellent ability against elephants, this study assessed the impact of small hive beetles (Aethina tumida) on bee (Apis mellifera adansonii) reproduction and ability to keep forest elephants (Loxodonta africana cyclotis) away. Because interspecies interactions are not easy to investigate, we have used camera traps and digital video to observe the activity of bees and their interactions with wild forest elephants under varying conditions of hive infestation with the small hive beetle, a common bee pest. Our results show that queen cells are good visual indicators of colony efficiency on keeping away forest elephants. We give evidences that small hive beetles are equivalently present in large and small bee colonies. Yet, results show no worries about the use of bees as elephant deterrents because of parasitism due to small hive beetles. Apis mellifera adansonii bees seem to effectively cope with small hive beetles showing no significant influence on its reproduction and ability to keep elephants away. This study also reports for the first time the presence of Aethina tumida as a constant beekeeping pest that needs to be addressed in Gabon. © Nature Conservation Research 2018.

Three different types of sensors were used, a leaf porometer to measure leaf stomatal conductance, a thermal infrared camera to measure the canopy temperature and a meteorological sensor to measure weather variables. Stomatal conductance of water stressed pear was significantly lower than in the control group 9 days after stress began. This decrease in stomatal conductance reduced transpiration, reducing evaporative cooling that increased canopy temperature. Using thermal infrared imaging with wavelengths between 7.5 and 13 μm, the first significant difference was measured 18 days after stress began. A second order derivative described the average rate of change of the difference between the stress treatment and control group. The average rate of change for stomatal conductance was 0.06 (mmolm-2 s-1) and for canopy temperature was -0.04 (°C) with respect to days. Thermal infrared remote sensing and data analysis presented in this study demonstrated that the differences in canopy temperatures between the water stress and control treatment due to stomata regulation can be validated. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Canopy temperature; Pear trees; Stomatal conductance; Thermal imaging; Vapor pressure deficit","fruit; infrared imagery; remote sensing; stomatal conductance; temporal variation; vapor pressure; water stress; Pyrus; Pyrus communis","Abramoff, M.D., Magalhaes, P.J., Ram, S.J., Image processing with imageJ (2004) Biophotonics Int, 11, pp. 36-42; (1998) Standard Test Methods for Measuring and Compensating for Reflected Temperature Using Infrared Imaging Radiometers, 100 Barr Harbor Drive, , West Conshohocken, PA; Anderson, D.B., Relative humidity or vapor pressure deficit (1936) Ecology, 17, pp. 277-282; Ballester, C., Castel, J., Jiménez-Bello, M.A., Castel, J.R., Intrigliolo, D.S., Thermographic measurement of canopy temperature is a useful tool for predicting water deficit effects on fruit weight in citrus trees (2013) Agric.

To protect endangered species, many countries worldwide have adopted the CITES treaty to prevent the extinction of endangered plants and animals. Moreover, research has been conducted using diverse approaches, particularly deep learning-based animal and plant image recognition methods. In this paper, we propose an automated image classification method for 11 endangered parrot species included in CITES. The 11 species include subspecies that are very similar in appearance. Data images were collected from the Internet and built in cooperation with Seoul Grand Park Zoo to build an indigenous database. The dataset for deep learning training consisted of 70% training set, 15% validation set, and 15% test set. In addition, a data augmentation technique was applied to reduce the data collection limit and prevent overfitting. The performance of various backbone CNN architectures (i.e., VGGNet, ResNet, and DenseNet) were compared using the SSD model. The experiment derived the test set image performance for the training model, and the results show that the DenseNet18 had the best performance with an mAP of approximately 96.6% and an inference time of 0.38 s. © 2021 by the authors.

To address this, we investigate asking judges to provide a specific form of rationale supporting each rating decision. We evaluate this approach on an information retrieval task in which human judges rate the relevance of Web pages for different search topics. Cost-benefit analysis over 10,000 judgments collected on Amazon's Mechanical Turk suggests a win-win. Firstly, rationales yield a multitude of benefits: more reliable judgments, greater transparency for evaluating both human raters and their judgments, reduced need for expert gold, the opportunity for dual-supervision from ratings and rationales, and added value from the rationales themselves. Secondly, once experienced in the task, crowd workers provide rationales with almost no increase in task completion time. Consequently, we can realize the above benefits with minimal additional cost.

Numerous approaches using infrared sensors have been proposed in the literature to detect and classify pedestrians in low visibility situations. However, the performance of these systems is limited by the capability of the classifier. This paper presents a novel method of classifying pedestrians in far-infrared automotive imagery. Regions of interest are segmented from the infrared frame using seeded region growing. A novel method of filtering the region growing results based on the location and size of the bounding box within the frame is described. This results in a smaller number of regions of interest for classification, leading to a reduced false positive rate. Histograms of oriented gradient features and local binary pattern features are extracted from the regions of interest and concatenated to form a feature for classification. Pedestrians are tracked with a Kalman filter to increase detection rates and system robustness. Detection rates of 98%, and false positive rates of 1% have been achieved on a database of 2000 images and streams of video; this is a 3% improvement on previously reported detection rates. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2015.","","Graphic methods; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; Infrared detectors; Kalman filters; False positive rates; Histograms of oriented gradients; Infra-red sensor; Local binary patterns; Night vision systems; Regions of interest; Seeded region growing; System robustness; Night vision devices","European New Car Assessment Program (Euro NCAP), , http://www.euroncap.com/, accessed January 2014; Hobbs, A., Euro NCAP/MORI survey on consumer buying interests (speech and presentation) (2005) Proc.

In Cameroon, these activities cause a loss of suitable primate habitat and could ultimately threaten the survival of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). We derived independent estimates of the population size of the Endangered Nigeria–Cameroon chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes ellioti) in Kom-Wum Forest Reserve, Cameroon, and surrounding unprotected forest areas through 1) direct observations, 2) camera trapping, 3) distance sampling, 4) marked nest counts, and 5) standing crop nest counts. In addition, we georeferenced signs of chimpanzee and human activity along line transects. We used a generalized linear mixed model to predict the occurrence of chimpanzees in response to edge length (measured as the perimeter of core forest patches), core area of forest patches (measured as area of forest patches beyond an edge width of 100 m), habitat perforation (measured as the perimeter of nonforested landscape within core forest patches), patch size(measured as area of forest patches), and forest cover. Chimpanzee density estimates ranged from 0.1 (direct observation) to 0.9 (distance sampling) individuals km−2 depending on estimation method with a mean nest group size of 7 ± 5.4 (SD). The mean encounter rate for signs of chimpanzee activity was significantly higher in mature forests (2.3 signs km−1) than in secondary forests (0.3 signs km−1) and above 1000 m elevation (4.0 signs km−1) than below 1000 m (1.0 signs km−1). The mean encounter rate for signs of human activity was significantly higher in secondary (8.0 signs km−1) than in mature forests (0.9 signs km−1). Secondary forests, habitat perforation, and edge length had a significant negative effect on the occurrence of chimpanzee signs. Overall, human activity and forest degradation affected the number of observed chimpanzee signs negatively. Regular antipoaching patrols and reforestation programs in degraded areas could potentially reduce threats to populations of endangered species and may increase suitable habitat area. © 2021, The Author(s).","Bushmeat hunting;

We used camera traps and capture-recapture analysis to provide the first reliable abundance and density estimates for the common leopard Panthera pardus and clouded leopard Neofelis nebulosa in Manas National Park, India. In 57 days of camera trapping, with a total of 4,275 camera-trap days, we photo-captured 27 individually identified common leopards (11 males, 13 females and three unidentified), and 16 clouded leopards (four males, five females and seven unidentified). The abundance estimates using the M h jackknife and Pledger model M h were 47.0 and 35.6, respectively, for the common leopard, and 21.0 and 25.0, respectively, for the clouded leopard. Density estimates using maximum likelihood spatially-explicit capture-recapture were 3.4 ± SE 0.82 and 4.73 ± SE 1.43 per 100 km2 for the common and clouded leopards, respectively. Spatially-explicit capture-recapture provided more realistic density estimates compared with those obtained from conventional methods. Our data indicates that camera trapping using a capture-recapture framework is an effective tool for assessing population sizes of cryptic and elusive carnivores such as the common and clouded leopards. The study has established a baseline for the long-term monitoring programme for large carnivores in Manas National Park.

Caruso 16, Pisa, 56122, Italy","We developed an algorithm for automatically detecting small and poorly contrasted (dim) moving objects in real-time, within video sequences acquired through a steady infrared camera. The algorithm is suitable for different situations since it is independent of the background characteristics and of changes in illumination. Unlike other solutions, small objects of any size (up to single-pixel), either hotter or colder than the background, can be successfully detected. The algorithm is based on accurately estimating the background at the pixel level and then rejecting it. A novel approach permits background estimation to be robust to changes in the scene illumination and to noise, and not to be biased by the transit of moving objects. Care was taken in avoiding computationally costly procedures, in order to ensure the real-time performance even using low-cost hardware. The algorithm was tested on a dataset of 12 video sequences acquired in different conditions, providing promising results in terms of detection rate and false alarm rate, independently of background and objects characteristics. In addition, the detection map was produced frame by frame in real-time, using cheap commercial hardware. The algorithm is particularly suitable for applications in the fields of video-surveillance and computer vision. Its reliability and speed permit it to be used also in critical situations, like in search and rescue, defence and disaster monitoring. © 2016 SPIE.","detect-before-track; detection; dim objects; IR video sequences; real-time; small objects","Adaptive optics; Computer hardware; Error detection; Estimation; Hardware; Object detection; Pixels; Remote sensing; Security systems; Video recording; detect-before-track; dim objects; Real time; Small objects; Video sequences; Signal detection","Huang, K., Mao, X., Detectability of infrared small targets (2010) Infrared Physics & Technology, 53, pp. 208-217; Bai, X., Survey on dim small target detection in clutter background: Wavelet, inter-frame and filter based algorithms (2011) Procedia Engineering, 15, pp. 327-336; Davey, S., A comparison of detection performance for several track-before-detect algorithms (2008) Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Information Fusion, pp. 1-8; Mohan, A., Papageorgiou, C., Poggio, T., Example-based object detection in images by components (2001) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, p. 23; Zivkovic, Z., Improve adaptive Gaussian mixture model for background subtraction (2004) Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR 2004), 2, pp. 28-31; Lei, L., Zhijian, H., Infrared small target detection technology based on opencv (2013) Proceedings of SPIE Signal Processing, , Sensor Fusion and Target Recognition XXII; Viola, P., Jones, M., Rapid object detection using a boosted cascade of simple features (2001) Proceedings of the 2001 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2001), 1, pp. 511-518; Chen, Z., Liu, C., Chang, F., Infrared small target detection algorithm based on feature salience (2011) International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, p. 25; Jihui, Y., Improved small target detection for ir point target (2009) International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz Waves (IRMMW-THz 2009), pp. 1-2; Zhang, F., Li, C., Shi, L., Detecting and tracking dim moving point target in ir image sequences (2005) Infrared Physics and Technology, p. 46; Zhan, C., An improved moving object detection algorithm based on frame difference and edge detection (2007) IEEE Fourth International Conference on Image and Graphic, pp. 519-523; Heikkilä, M., Pietikäinen, M., A texture-based method for modeling the background and detecting moving objects (2006) IEEE Transaction on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 28, pp. 657-662; Lemire, D., Streaming maximum-minimum filter using no more than three comparisons per element (2006) Nordic Journal of Computing, 13 (4), pp. 328-339; Hung, M., Pan, J., Speed up temporal median filter for background subtraction (2010) Proceedings of the First International Conference on Pervasive Computing, Signal Processing and Application, pp. 297-300; Wren, C., Pfinder: Real-time tracking of the human body (1997) IEEE Transaction on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 9, pp. 780-785; Tursun, D., Guiying, X., Hamdulla, A., A particle filter based algorithm for state estimation of dim moving point target in ir image sequence (2008) Second International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application (IITA 08), pp. 127-131; Holstt, G.C., (2003) Electro-optical Imaging System Performance, , JCD Publishing & SPIE, third ed; Dudzik, M.C., Electro-optical system design, analysis, and testing (1996) The Infrared & Electro-Optical Systems Handbook, 4 (12), p. 22. , Accetta, J.

Between January 2017–February 2018, we carried out a camera trapping survey of animals in a mixed peat-swamp forest partly affected by El Niño driven forest fires in 1998. This survey was conducted in the Klias Forest Reserve (KFR), of western Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. In addition to natural regeneration, the burnt areas in this peat forest have undergone active forest rehabilitation since 2006, including enrichment planting with indigenous tree species. We identified 22 animal species (16 mammals and six birds) in the surveyed areas including common and rarer species of high conservation value. The richness of animal species detected in the rehabilitated (formerly burnt forest) and the nearby intact (unburnt) forest areas was generally comparable. The similarity of detected animal species composition in each forest condition was also high (74% for all animal species combined; 86% for mammal species). Additionally, six of the seven most frequently photographed species did not show any significant difference in daytime and nighttime activity patterns in the rehabilitated as compared to intact forest. Interestingly, mousedeer species (Tragulus napu and T. kanchil) were found to be significantly more active during the daytime in intact (unburnt) forest compared to the rehabilitated. However, we suspect higher daytime mousedeer activity in intact areas is a behavioural adaptation to increased hunting pressure at night in this forest rather than a result of the local habitat conditions. Overall, our findings suggest that the rehabilitated mixed peat-swamp forest burnt 20 years ago, acts as an important functional extension to the intact forest of the KFR ecosystem and provides useful additional habitat for animal conservation. © National University of Singapore.","Activity patterns;

Few studies have compared the quantity and quality of seed dispersal by megaherbivores versus alternative frugivores in the wild, particularly for plant species with fruit easily consumed by many frugivorous species. In a disturbed tropical moist forest in India, we examine whether megaherbivores are a major frugivore of two tree species with easily edible, mammal-dispersed fruit. We quantify the relative fruit removal rates of Artocarpus chaplasha and Careya arborea, by the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) and alternative dispersers. Through focal watches and camera trapping, we found the elephant to be amongst the top three frugivores for each tree species. Furthermore, seed transects under A. chaplasha show that arboreal frugivores discard seeds only a short distance from the parental tree, underscoring the elephant's role as a long-distance disperser. Our data provide unprecedented support for an old notion: megaherbivores may be key dispersers for a broad set of mammal-dispersed fruiting species, and not just fruit inaccessible to smaller frugivores. As such, the elephant may be particularly important for the functional ecology of the disturbed forests it still inhabits across tropical Asia. © 2015 Cambridge University Press.","Artocarpus chaplasha; Buxa Tiger Reserve; Careya arborea; domestic bovids; Elephas maximus; frugivory; functional ecology; Macaca mulatta; rhesus macaques","domestic species; edible species; frugivory; fruit; fruiting; plant-herbivore interaction; primate; seed dispersal; shrub; wild population; Buxa Tiger Reserve; India; Animalia; Artocarpus; Bovidae; Careya arborea; Elephas maximus; Macaca mulatta; Mammalia","Blake, S., Deem, S.L., Mossimbo, E., Maisels, F., Walsh, P., Forest elephants: Tree planters of the Congo (2009) Biotropica, 41, pp. 459-468; Campos-Arceiz, A., Blake, S., Megagardeners of the forest - The role of elephants in seed dispersal (2011) Acta Oecologia, 37, pp. 542-553; Campos-Arceiz, A., Larrinaga, A.R., Weerasinghe, U.R., Takatsuki, S., Pastorini, J., Leimgruber, P., Fernando, P., Santamarial, Behaviorratherthandiet mediates seasonal differences in seed dispersal by Asian elephants (2008) Ecology, 89, pp. 2684-2691; Cochrane, E.P., The need to be eaten: Balanites wilsoniana with and without elephant seed-dispersal (2003) Journal of Tropical Ecology, 19, pp. 579-589; Corlett, R.T., Frugivory and seed dispersal by vertebrates in the Oriental (Indomalayan) region (1998) Biological Reviews, 73, pp. 413-448; Corlett, R.T., The impact of hunting on the mammalian fauna of tropical Asian forests (2007) Biotropica, 39, pp. 292-303; Corlett, R.T., Seed dispersal distances and plant migration potential in tropical East Asia (2009) Biotropica, 41, pp. 592-598; Corlett, R.T., The shifted baseline: Prehistoric defaunation in the tropics and its consequences for biodiversity conservation (2013) Biological Conservation, 163, pp. 13-21; Corlett, R., Lucas, P., Alternative seed-handling strategies in primates: Seed-spitting by long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) (1990) Oecologia, 82, pp. 166-171; Datta, A., Rawat, G.S., Dispersal modes and spatial patterns of tree species in a tropical forest in Arunachal Pradesh, northeast India (2008) Tropical Conservation Science, 1, pp. 163-185; Davison, A.C., Hinkley, D.V., (1997) Bootstrap Methods and Their Application, p. 594. , Cambridge University Press, New York; Dennis, A.J., Westcott, D.A., Reducing complexity when studying seed dispersal at community scales: A functional classification of vertebrate seed dispersers in tropical forests (2006) Oecologia, 149, pp. 620-634; Dinerstein, E., (2003) The Return of the Unicorns: The Natural History and Conservation of the One-horned Rhinoceros, p. 384. , Columbia University Press, New York; Guimarães, P.R., Galetti, M., Jordano, P., Seed dispersal anachronisms: Rethinking the fruit extinctmegafauna ate (2008) PLoS ONE, 3 (3), p. e1745; Hansen, D.M., Galetti, M., The forgotten mega fauna (2009) Science, 324, pp. 42-43; Janzen, D.H., Martin, P.S., Neotropical anachronisms: The fruit the gomphotheres ate (1982) Science, 215, pp. 19-27; Jordano, P., Schupp, E.W., Seed disperser effectiveness: The quantity component and patterns of seed rain for Prunus mahaleb (2000) Ecological Monographs, 70, pp. 591-615; Kitamura, S., Yumoto, T., Poonswad, P., Chuailua, P., Plongmai, K., Maruhashi, T., Noma, N., Interactions between fleshy fruit and frugivores in a tropical seasonal forest in Thailand (2002) Oecologia, 133, pp. 559-572; Kitamura, S., Suzuki, S., Yumoto, T., Poonswad, P., Chuailua, P., Plongmai, K., Noma, N., Suckasam, C., Dispersal of Aglaia spectabilis, a large-seeded tree species in a moist evergreen forest in Thailand (2004) Journal of Tropical Ecology, 20, pp. 421-427; Kitamura, S., Suzuki, S., Yumoto, T., Chuailua, P., Plongmai, K., Poonswad, P., Noma, N., Suckasam, C., A botanical inventory of a tropical seasonal forest in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand: Implications for fruit-frugivore interactions (2005) Biodiversity and Conservation, 14, pp. 1241-1262; Kitamura, S., Suzuki, S., Yumoto, T., Poonswad, P., Chuailua, P., Plongmai, K., Maruhashi, T., Suckasam, C., Dispersal of Canarium euphyllum (Burseraceae), a large-seeded tree species, in a moist evergreen forest in Thailand (2006) Journal of Tropical Ecology, 22, pp. 137-146; Kitamura, S., Yumoto, T., Poonswad, P., Wohandee, P., Frugivory and seed dispersal by Asian elephants, Elephas maximus, in a moist evergreen forest of Thailand (2007) Journal of Tropical Ecology, 23, pp. 373-376; Mabberley, D.J., (1997) The Plant-book: A Portable Dictionary of the Vascular Plants, p. 1040. , Cambridge University Press, New York; MacNae, W., Fosberg, F.R., Lecythidaceae (1981) A Revised Handbook to the Flora of Ceylon, 3, pp. 195-202. , in Dassanayake, M.

This paper attempts to solve this problem using deep learning techniques from a variety of computer vision fields including object detection, segmentation, tracking and edge detection. Several interesting insights into transfer learning are elicited while adapting models trained on benchmark datasets for real world deployment. Empirical evidence is presented to demonstrate the inability of detectors to generalize from training images of animals in their natural habitats to deployment scenarios of man-made environments. A solution is also proposed using semi-automated synthetic data generation for domain specific training. Code and data used in the experiments are made available to facilitate further work in this domain. © 2020 IEEE.","","Animals; Deep learning; Learning systems; Motor transportation; Object detection; Object tracking; Transfer learning; Automatic Detection; Benchmark datasets; Deployment scenarios; Domain specific; Inhabited areas; Learning techniques; Real world deployment; Synthetic data generations; Computer vision","(2018), http://cocodataset.org/, COCO Dataset September; (2019), https://github.com/msracver/FCIS, Fully Convolutional Instance-aware Semantic Segmentation September; (2019), https://labelbox.com/, Labelbox; (2019), http://lila.science/datasets1, Labeled information library of alexandria: Biology and conservation.

We systematically reviewed 126 relevant papers that study the impact of outdoor recreation on wildlife, focusing on terrestrial wildlife (birds excluded) to assess the different methodological approaches adopted by researchers. We characterised the research methods into seven categories (direct observation, indirect observation (field-based), telemetry, camera traps, physiological measurement, trapping, and simulation). We find that direct observation is the most commonly used method to capture human-wildlife interactions, followed by the use of telemetry, and camera traps. The animals most commonly studied were ungulates, and the orders Carnivora and Rodentia. Studies typically captured data over longer periods (median 54 months) when using trapping methods; other methods exhibited shorter study durations (median 22 months). The size of the animal under study appears to influence how methods are chosen, with larger species often being studied using telemetry methods. We highlight advantages and disadvantages of each method depending on the aims of the study, the focal species, and the type of outdoor recreation. Our review highlights the need for simultaneous measurements of both human activity and wildlife response. We also recommend that researchers consider how to capture both short- and long-term impacts on animal welfare. Our findings should guide applied wildlife conservation and management research in scenarios where human-wildlife interactions lead to conservation issues. © 2020","Data collection; Human-wildlife conflict; Method; Outdoor recreation; Review","","Austin, Z., Cinderby, S., Smart, J.C.R., Raffaelli, D., White, P.C.L., Mapping wildlife: integrating stakeholder knowledge with modelled patterns of deer abundance by using participatory GIS (2009) Wildl.

Because of the low requirements on the calibration images, our solution is particularly suited for endoscopic camera calibration. It successfully copes with strong lens distortions, partially occluded patterns, image blur, and image noise. Our detector initially uses a sparse sampling method to find some connected squares of the chessboard pattern in the image. A pattern-growing strategy iteratively locates adjacent chessboard corners with a region-based corner detector. The corner detector examines entire image regions with the help of the integral image to handle poor image quality. We show that it outperforms recent solutions in terms of detection rates and performs at least equally well in terms of accuracy. © 2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.","Camera Calibration; Checkerboard Detection; Chessboard Detection; Endoscope Calibration; Integral Image","Calibration; Cameras; Computer graphics; Computer vision; Endoscopy; Iterative methods; Camera calibration; Corner detector; Detection rates; Endoscopic camera; Image regions; Integral images; Lens distortion; Sparse sampling; Edge detection","Barreto, J., Roquette, J., Sturm, P., Fonseca, F., Automatic camera calibration applied to medical endoscopy (2009) Proceedings of the British Machine Vision Conference; Brown, D.C., Close-range camera calibration (1971) Photogrammetric Engineering, 37; Cootes, T.F., Taylor, C.J., Active shape models-'smart snakes' (1992) Proceedings of the British Machine Vision Conference; Hart, P.E., Stork, D.G., (2001) Pattern Classification, 2nd Edition, , Wiley; Ernst, A., Papst, A., Ruf, T., Garbas, J.-U., Check my chart: A robust color chart tracker for colorimetric camera calibration (2013) Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Computer Vision / Computer Graphics Collaboration Techniques and Applications; Fiala, M., Shu, C., (2005) Fully Automatic Camera Calibration Using Self-identifying Calibration Targets, , Technical report, National Research Council Canada; Fuersattel, P., Dotenco, S., Placht, S., Balda, M., Maier, A., Riess, C., OCPAD-occluded checkerboard pattern detector (2016) Proceedings of the IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision; Heikkila, J., Silven, O., A four-step camera calibration procedure with implicit image correction (1997) Proceedings of the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Li, W., Nie, S., Soto-Thompson, M., Chen, C.-I., A'Rahim, Y.I., Robust distortion correction of endoscope (2008) Proceedings of the International Society for Optical Engineering; Mallon, J., Whelan, P.F., Which pattern?.

We present the results of a long-term study (2010-2012) of this endangered species in northwestern Greece. Occurrence of otters at the Lakes Zazari and Himaditida was assessed using standard sign surveys, dietary habits were investigated through spraint analysis, and activity patterns were studied using automatic infrared cameras. Otter occurrence was widespread throughout the study area and continuous during the monitoring period and included the presence of a family group. Otter diet included a high proportion of birds, and activity was nocturnal. More systematic monitoring and management efforts and the development of a Species Action Plan are necessary to ensure the survival of the Eurasian otter in Greece. © 2014 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin/Boston.","conservation; diet; Greece; Lutra lutra; Species Action Plan","","Bousbouras, D., Georgiadis, L., Alonso, S., Phirriard, C., Ruiz Ruiz, C., Aubin, E., Investigation of the feeding habits of otters in lakes of western Macedonia.

Based on a systematic year-long camera-trap study in the species-rich mammal assemblage of Lake Manyara National Park (Tanzania), we estimated activity levels (hours active per day) and circadian rhythms of 17 herbivore and 11 faunivore species to determine the effects of body mass and trophic level on activity levels and cathemerality (the degree to which species are active throughout the day and night). Using generalized least squares and phylogenetic generalized least squares analyses, we found no support for the hypothesis that trophic level is positively associated with activity levels. We found no support for activity levels to scale positively with body mass in herbivores or to differ between ruminants and nonruminants; in faunivores, we also did not detect relationships between body mass and activity levels. Cathemerality was positively associated with activity levels but did not scale significantly with body mass. Overall, our findings caution against trophic level or body mass-associated generalized conclusions with regard to diel activity patterns. © 2021 The Authors.

Community science, satellite remote sensing (SRS), and local forms of remote sensing (e.g., camera traps and acoustic recordings) have enabled biological data to be collected at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales and resolution. There is growing interest in developing observation networks to collect and synthesize data to improve broad-scale ecological monitoring, but no examples of such networks have emerged to inform decision-making by agencies. Here, we present the implementation of one such jurisdictional observation network (JON), Snapshot Wisconsin, which links synoptic environmental data derived from SRS to biodiversity observations collected continuously from a trail camera network to support management decision-making. We use several examples to illustrate that Snapshot Wisconsin improves the spatial, temporal, and biological resolution and extent of information available to support management, filling gaps associated with traditional monitoring and enabling consideration of new management strategies. JONs like Snapshot Wisconsin further strengthen monitoring inference by contributing novel lines of evidence useful for corroboration or integration. SRS provides environmental context that facilitates inference, prediction, and forecasting, and ultimately helps managers formulate, test, and refine conceptual models for the monitored systems. Although these approaches pose challenges, Snapshot Wisconsin demonstrates that expansive observation networks can be tractably managed by agencies to support decision making, providing a powerful new tool for agencies to better achieve their missions and reshape the nature of environmental decision-making. © 2021 The Authors.

These species have expanded their distribution and increased in abundance across Japan and are causing increased agricultural damage. Effective countermeasures must factor in the behavioural flexibility of sika deer and wild boar. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of hunting and indirect human activities on the activity patterns of sika deer in central Japan and compare these with previous findings on wild boar. Camera traps were used to observe activity patterns of both species and that of humans. Sika deer and wild boar were most active at night during the non-hunting season. Hunting activities significantly reduced sika deer and wild boar activity patterns. In the non-hunting season, nocturnal activity of sika deer increased with decreasing distance to settlement. A similar, but weak response was also observed for wild boar. This study suggests that sika deer and wild boar avoid humans and human-dominated areas by being nocturnal. The recent introduction of night hunting might help to control wildlife populations, but monitoring will be necessary to confirm this expectation. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Activity pattern; Camera traps; Cervus nippon; Human activity; Hunting; Sus scrofa","Cervus nippon; Sus scrofa","Adams, C.E., Lindsey, K.J., Ash, S.J., (2006) Urban Wildlife Management, , CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL; Agetsuma, N., Ecological function losses caused by monotonous land use induce crop raiding by wildlife on the island of Yakushima, Southern Japan (2007) Ecol Res, 22, pp. 390-402; Agetsuma, N., Koda, R., Tsujino, R., Agetsuma-Yanagihara, Y., Impact of anthropogenic disturbance on the density and activity pattern of deer evaluated with respect to spatial scale-dependency (2014) Mamm Biol, 79, pp. 44-51; Allendorf, F.W., England, P.R., Luikart, G., Ritchie, P.A., Ryman, N., Genetic effects of harvest on wild animal populations (2008) Trends Ecol Evol, 23, pp. 327-337. , PID: 18439706; Balmford, A., Bartoš, L., Brotherton, P., Herrmann, H., Lancingerova, J., Mika, J., Zeeb, U., When to stop lekking: density‐related variation in the rutting behaviour of sika deer (1993) J Zool, 231, pp. 652-656; Bartoń, K., Package ‘MuMIn’.

The proposed detection system is activated when an object approaches its field of vision, by the use of deep learning techniques, automated object recognition is achieved. For training, we use a labeled dataset from the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure’s (BCMOTI) wildlife program, and the Snapshot Wisconsin dataset as well. By using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, we can train a system capable of filtering images from these datasets and identifying its objects automatically.

Label acquisition for tasks other than benchmarks can pose a challenge due to requirements of both funding and expertise. By selecting unlabeled examples that are promising in terms of model improvement and only asking for respective labels, active learning can increase the efficiency of the labeling process in terms of time and cost. In this work, we describe combinations of an incremental learning scheme and methods of active learning. These allow for continuous exploration of newly observed unlabeled data. We describe selection criteria based on model uncertainty as well as expected model output change (EMOC). An object detection task is evaluated in a continuous exploration context on the PASCAL VOC dataset. We also validate a weakly supervised system based on active and incremental learning in a real-world biodiversity application where images from camera traps are analyzed. Labeling only 32 images by accepting or rejecting proposals generated by our method yields an increase in accuracy from 25.4 to 42.6%. © 2020, The Author(s).","Active learning; Incremental learning; Object detection;

Placing additional cameras at a survey station may improve precision of occupancy and detection estimates. However, these benefits are situational and potentially influenced by species' physical characteristics and behavior. We estimated null occupancy and detection probabilities for 20 mammalian species with >10 detections at multiple sites from one- and two-camera data sets from 63 stations set in a commercial forest reserve in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo during October–December 2015. We used a cross-validated absolute shrinkage and selection operator approach to model the effects of species’ body mass, social behavior, dietary niche, and foot posture on detection probability using one- and two-camera designs. The number of species detections, sites where species were detected, detection probability estimates, and precision of model parameter estimates for all species improved using two cameras. Our results showed that unguligrade species were associated with both high detection probability estimates with one camera and also the greatest improvements using the two-camera design in detection probability compared to all other species. Greater improvements in precision of model parameter estimates from two-camera designs were observed in species detected less frequently. Our data suggests that camera designs need to be adapted based on the focal species and we suggest that future occupancy studies collect preliminary information to maximize effectiveness of camera effort and ensure that data collection is efficient and meets project needs. © 2019","Camera trapping; LASSO regression; Occupancy modelling","","Normua, F., Higashi, S., Ambu, L., Mohamed, M., Notes on oil palm plantation use and seasonal spatial relationships of sun bears in Sabah (2004) Malaysia.

The process is both time-consuming and labour-intensive. Drones have been used to help mitigate human-intensive tasks by covering large geographical areas over a much shorter timescale. In this paper we investigate this idea further using a proof of concept to detect rhinos and cars from drone footage. The proof of concept utilises off-the-shelf technology and consumer-grade drone hardware. The study demonstrates the feasibility of using machine learning (ML) to automate routine conservation tasks, such as animal detection and tracking. The prototype has been developed using a DJI Mavic Pro 2 and tested over a global system for mobile communications (GSM) network. The Faster-RCNN Resnet 101 architecture is used for transfer learning. Inference is performed with a frame sampling technique to address the required trade-off between precision, processing speed, and live video feed synchronisation. Inference models are hosted on a web platform and video streams from the drone (using OcuSync) are transmitted to a real-time messaging protocol (RTMP) server for subsequent classification. During training, the best model achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.83 intersection over union (@IOU) 0.50 and 0.69 @IOU 0.75, respectively. On testing the system in Knowsley Safari our prototype was able to achieve the following: Sensitivity (Sen), 0.91 (0.869, 0.94); specificity (Spec), 0.78 (0.74, 0.82); and an accuracy (ACC), 0.84 (0.81, 0.87) when detecting rhinos, and Sen, 1.00 (1.00, 1.00); Spec, 1.00 (1.00, 1.00); and an ACC, 1.00 (1.00, 1.00) when detecting cars. © 2021, Canadian Science Publishing.

For decades, field-based fixed-point monitoring, on-board vehicle movement monitoring and satellite remote sensing were the information acquisition techniques for the quantitative detection of crop water stress and irrigation decision-making. The emergence of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) fundamentally solved the technical problems of satellite remote sensing caused by its low temporal-spatial resolution, including instantaneous extension, spatial scale conversion, quantitative correspondence between remote sensing parameters and model parameters. At the same time, UAV remote sensing technology also solved the problems of ground monitoring methods, such as low efficiency and high cost. Research results in recent years showed that the UAV remote sensing system could obtain high-temporal resolution images of multiple plots with high throughput, making it possible to analyze the spatial variability of agro-meteorological conditions, soil conditions, crop phenotypes and their mutual relationships accurately. It provided a new method for quickly sensing the spatial variability of crop water stress within a large area of farmland, which had obvious advantages and broad prospects in the application of precision irrigation. UAV remote sensing technology was successfully applied to obtain agricultural information, including fractional vegetation cover, plant height, lodging area, biomass, leaf area index and canopy temperature. However, study on quantitative indicator monitoring for crop water stress detection and irrigation decision-making has just started. At present, it mainly focuses on crop water stress index (CWSI), crop coefficient, canopy structural index, soil water content, PRI etc. Some of the above indicators were successfully applied to monitor the water stress status of various crops, but for most crops and indicators, further study is needed to improve the universality of the model. The technical process and key points of UAV application in precision irrigation were given. To meet the needs of high-efficiency monitoring and accurate dynamic management of agricultural water at different scales, UAV remote sensing needs to be combined with satellite remote sensing and ground monitoring systems in the future. The optimization layout method and intelligent networking technology of sky-integrated agricultural water information monitoring network, fusion and assimilation technology of multi-source information, comprehensive diagnosis model with multiple water stress indicators, and big data on agricultural irrigation would be the hotspots of future research. © 2020, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

In Brazil, lowland tapirs are considered vulnerable according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and endangered within the Atlantic Rain Forest biome. We aimed to provide the 1st estimates of density and population size for T. terrestris for Vale Natural Reserve (VNR). We predicted the relationships of 6 covariates to habitat occupancy. Density was estimated by the use of distance-sampling techniques, while occupancy, detectability, and activity patterns were assessed with camera-trap monitoring at 39 sample sites over a 1-year period. Density for T. terrestris was 0.8 ± 0.2 lowland tapirs/km2 and population size was 200 ± 33 individuals. Occupancy probability was described by 2 covariates (density of palm trees and distance to water resources) and detectability by those same 2 covariates plus 2 more (distance to road and density of poaching). The species showed the 3 highest peaks of activity at 1900, 2300, and 0400 h. We concluded that VNR still harbors a viable population of lowland tapirs. However, anthropic impacts in the reserve such as poaching and road kills could already be directly affecting the lowland tapir population and producing indirect effects for the whole ecosystem. Results presented herein can be a starting point to support future work in the region and to make predictions regarding the ecosystem relationships, management, and conservation of lowland tapirs. A anta brasileira (Tapirus terrestris, Linnaeus 1758) é considerada uma das espécies sobreviventes da megafauna neotropical. No Brasil, a anta é considerada vulnerável de acordo com a lista vermelha de espécies ameaçadas da IUCN e considerada em perigo para o bioma da Mata Atlântica. Nosso objetivo foi fornecer as primeiras estimativas de densidade e tamanho populacional de T. terrestris para a Reserva Natural Vale (RNV). Além disso, nós testamos o efeito de 6 covariadas para modelar ocupação do habitat. Estimamos a densidade e o tamanho populacional com a técnica de amostragem de distância por transecção linear. A detectabilidade, ocupação e período de atividade foram estimados com o uso de armadilhas fotográficas em 39 sítios amostrais por um período de 1 ano. Estimamos uma densidade de 0,8 ± 0,2 antas/km2 e um tamanho populacional de 200 ± 33 indivíduos. A probabilidade de ocupação foi representada por 2 covariadas (i.e. densidade de palmeiras e distância do recurso hídrico), e a detectabilidade pelas mesmas covariadas anteriores com a adição de outras 2 (i.e. distância da rodovia e densidade de caça). A população presente na RNV apresentou 3 picos de atividade, às 19:00, 23:00, e 04:00 horas. Nós concluímos que a RNV ainda pode apresentar uma população viável de anta. Porém, os impactos antrópicos presentes na reserva (como a caça ilegal e morte por atropelamentos) podem já estar diretamente afetando a população de anta e produzindo um efeito indireto em todo o ecossistema. Os resultados aqui apresentados podem ser o ponto inicial para o desenvolvimento de futuros estudos na região e também para predições sobre medidas de manejo e conservação da anta e de todo o ecossistema. © 2017 American Society of Mammalogists.","Camera trap; Distance sampling; Poaching; Road impact; Tapirus terrestris","activity pattern; anthropogenic effect; biomonitoring; conservation management; detection method; ecosystem management; endangered species; lowland environment; mammal; nature reserve; Neotropical Region; population density; population size; rainforest; Red List; sampling; species occurrence; vulnerability; Brazil; Tapirus terrestris","Akaike, H., Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle (1973) Second International Symposium on Information Theory, pp. 267-281. , B.

However, to design a networked monitoring system, it is necessary to realize a balance between the monitoring accuracy and monitoring cost, for instance, between the network traffic to transmit images and the computation load. Although the monitoring cost can be decreased by increasing the sampling interval of cameras, it becomes more likely that informative images cannot be obtained; in other words, the monitoring accuracy decreases with a reduction in the amount of data. Moreover, although on-device image processing can decrease the network traffic, a large computation delay may be incurred, limiting the sampling rate of the monitoring system. The objective of this study was to examine the balance between the monitoring accuracy and cost and to develop a joint optimization technique for the sampling interval and computation offloading to minimize the monitoring cost in a networked monitoring system while ensuring a high monitoring accuracy. The main contributions of this paper are that we prove the joint optimization problem can be solved explicitly and to develop an algorithm to obtain the solution of the joint optimization problem. The simulation results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can reduce the monitoring cost by 24-48% while maximizing the number of nodes ensured to achieve high monitoring accuracy. © 2021 IEEE.","","Agricultural robots; Cost reduction; Image processing; Network security; Optimization; Automatic monitoring; Computation offloading; Industry automation; Joint optimization; Monitoring accuracy; Monitoring system; Sampling interval; Smart agricultures; Monitoring","Zhang, F., Liu, M., Zhou, Z., Shen, W., An IoT-based online monitoring system for continuous steel casting (2016) IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 3 (6), pp. 1355-1363; Javed, O., Shah, M., Tracking and object classification for automated surveillance (2002) Proc.

In this work, we focus on analyzing and quantifying the influence of landscape topology, understood as the spatial structure and interaction of multiple land-covers in an area, on fire ignition. We propose a deep learning framework, Deep Fire Topology, to estimate and predict wildfire ignition risk. We focus on understanding the impact of these topological attributes and the rationale behind the results to provide interpretable knowledge for territorial planning considering wildfire ignition uncertainty. We demonstrate the high performance and interpretability of the framework in a case study, accurately detecting risky areas by exploiting spatial patterns. This work reveals the strong potential of landscape topology in wildfire occurrence prediction and its implications to develop robust landscape management plans.

A key assumption of this model is that cameras are placed randomly in relation to animal movements, requiring that cameras are not set only at sites thought to have high animal traffic. The aim of this study was to define a correction factor that allows the random encounter model to be applied in photo-trapping surveys in which cameras are placed along tracks to maximize capture probability. Our hypothesis was that applying such a correction factor would compensate for the different rates at which lynxes use tracks and the surrounding area, and should thus improve the estimates obtained with the random encounter model. We tested this using data from a well-known Iberian lynx Lynx pardinus population. Firstly, we estimated Iberian lynx densities using a traditional camera-trapping design followed by spatially explicit capture-recapture analyses. We estimated the differential use rate for tracks vs the surrounding area using data from a lynx equipped with a GPS collar, and subsequently calculated the correction factor. As expected, the random encounter model overestimated densities by 378%. However, the application of the correction factor improved the estimate and reduced the error to 16%. Although there are limitations to the application of the correction factor, the corrected random encounter model shows potential for density estimation of species for which individual identification is not possible.

Classification, a supervised learning method, is mostly applicable method of data mining. In this paper, we have used different classification techniques to differentiate the results for different data sets. Deep learning or hierarchical learning is the part of machine learning which mainly follows the widely used concepts of a neural network. There are many deep learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, etc. In this paper, we have used the concept of deep recurrent neural network (Deep-RNN) to train the model for a classification task. RNN follows a method for weight updation which is known as Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) and we have used the concept of Deep-RNN by following the concepts of both forward pass and backward pass. Simulation results are quite impressive as compared to earlier developed machine learning models. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Classification; Data mining; Deep learning; Deep recurrent neural network","Classification (of information); Convolutional neural networks; Data mining; Deep learning; Digital storage; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Recurrent neural networks; Backpropagation through time; Classification tasks; Classification technique; Deep belief networks; Hierarchical learning; Learning architectures; Machine learning models; Supervised learning methods; Deep neural networks","Katircioglu, I., Tekin, B., Salzmann, M., Lepetit, V., Fua, P., Learning latent representations of 3d human pose with deep neural networks (2018) Int.

The key technology for developing such a system is the capability of automatically understanding and characterizing driver behaviors. This paper proposes a novel driving posture recognition approach, which consists of an efficient combined feature extraction and a random subspace ensemble of multilayer perceptron classifiers. A Southeast University Driving Posture Database (SEU-DP Database) has been created for training and testing the proposed approach. The data set contains driver images of (1) grasping the steering wheel, (2) operating the shift lever, (3) eating a cake and (4) talking on a cellular phone. Combining spatial scale features and histogram-based features, holdout and cross-validation experiments on driving posture classification are conducted, comparatively. The experimental results indicate that the proposed combined feature extraction approach with random subspace ensemble of multilayer perceptron classifiers outperforms the two individual feature extraction approaches. The experiments also suggest that talking on a cellular phone is the most difficult posture in classification among the four predefined postures. Using the proposed approach, the classification accuracy on talking on a cellular phone is over 89 % in both holdout and cross-validation experiments. These results show the effectiveness of the proposed combined feature extraction approach and random subspace ensemble of multilayer perceptron classifiers in automatically understanding and characterizing driver behaviors toward human-centric driver assistance systems. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.","Combined features;

Dholes (Cuon alpinus) are categorised by IUCN as Endangered since 2004. Their global range is believed to have rapidly shrunk and their current distribution on Sumatra Island is greatly reduced. Despite the situation, dholes have received much less conservation attention than other charismatic carnivores. As a consequence, knowledge on their basic ecology is poorly documented. Using camera trap results from tiger and prey studies, we aimed to describe the activity pattern, abundance, and distribution of dholes in the lowland and hilly forests of Rimbang Baling and Tesso Nilo landscapes. Six sampling blocks within four major protected areas in southern Riau Province were sampled from 2012 to 2015, covering a total area of 935 km2 with a total effort of 14,013 effective trap nights across 148 camera stations. We obtained 275 images of dholes with 37 independent pictures or 0.26 independent pictures of dholes per 100 trap nights. This study confirmed that Tesso Nilo, Rimbang Baling, Bukit Bungkuk, and Bukit Betabuh are occupied by dholes. Bukit Bungkuk had a relatively high trapping success rate (0.44 independent pictures per 100 trap nights), followed by northeastern and northwestern parts of Rimbang Baling (0.40 and 0.30, respectively). Dholes were recorded mostly active during the day, and in times between night and dusk or dawn. The Maximum Entropy model showed that distribution of dholes was mainly determined by land cover (percent contribution of 83.3%), followed by road (8.7%), river (6.5%), and elevation (1.5%). Information from this study, including the distribution model, can be used to update the management strategy and actions on the ground, in protecting and restoring forests to conserve this species in Sumatra. © National University of Singapore.",". canid conservation; Connectivity; Habitat determinants; MaxEnt; Spatial analysis","","Azlan, M, Sharma, DS, The diversity and activity patterns of wild felids in a secondary forest in Peninsular Malaysia (2006) Oryx, 40, pp. 36-41; (2013) Badan Informasi Geospasial [Geospatial Information Agency], , http://www.big.go.id/, Badan Informasi Geospasial Bogor, Indonesia.

Currently, the ability to collect such recordings outstrips the ability to analyze them manually, necessitating the development of automatic analysis methods. While several datasets and models of large corpora of video soundtracks have recently been released, it is not clear to what extent these models will generalize to environmental recordings and the scientific questions of interest in analyzing them. This paper investigates this generalization in several ways and finds that models themselves display limited performance, however, their intermediate representations can be used to train successful models on small sets of labeled data. © 2020 IEEE.","Ecoacoustics; soundscape analysis; transfer learning","Audio recordings; Large dataset; Satellite imagery; Sound recording; Speech communication; Transfer learning; Automatic analysis method; Field observations; Intermediate representations; Large corpora; Long term monitoring; Spatial scale; YouTube; Audio signal processing","Richter-Menge, J., Jeffries, M.O., Osborne, E., The arctic (2018) Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society: State of the Climate in 2018, 99, pp. S143-S168. , chapter 5 Jessica Blunden and Derek S.

Camera trapping has proven efficient for sampling multiple species, but statistical estimators of density from camera trapping data for species that cannot be individually identified are still in development. We extend point-transect methods for estimating animal density to accommodate data from camera traps, allowing researchers to exploit existing distance sampling theory and software for designing studies and analysing data. We tested it by simulation, and used it to estimate densities of Maxwell's duikers (Philantomba maxwellii) in Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire. Densities estimated from simulated data were unbiased when we assumed animals were not available for detection during long periods of rest. Estimated duiker densities were higher than recent estimates from line transect surveys, which are believed to underestimate densities of forest ungulates. We expect these methods to provide an effective means to estimate animal density from camera trapping data and to be applicable in a variety of settings. © 2017 The Authors.

Specifically, animal breed classification is an arduous task due to the challenges in camera traps images like occlusion, camouflage, poor illumination, pose variation, etc. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained animal breed classification model using supervised clustering based on Multi Part-Convolutional Neural Network (MP-CNN) and Expectation–Maximization (EM) clustering. The proposed model follows a straightforward pipeline that combines the deep feature extraction using the CNN pre-trained on ImageNet and classifies unsupervised data using EM clustering. Further, we also propose a multi discriminative part selection and detection for the precise classification of animal breeds without using bounding box and annotations on both training and testing phases. The model is tested on several benchmark datasets for animals, including the largest camera trap Snapshot Serengeti dataset and has achieved a cumulative accuracy of 98.4%. The results from the proposed model strengthen the belief that supervised training of deep CNN on a large and versatile dataset, extracts better features than most of the traditional approaches, even for the unsupervised tasks. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Expectation–maximization;

Increases in predator populations and nest predation may play an important role in this decline, along with habitat loss. However, the role of various predators has often remained unclear. We conducted a study with artificial nests and wildlife cameras (n = 104) in agricultural landscapes during 2015–2016 in South Finland. Our trials formed a 400-m wide gradient from forest to field. The aim of our study was to monitor nest survival and nest predators in a spatial and temporal scale. We tested the effect of distance to the forest and nest visibility to nest predation. During an 8-day period, 39.4% of the artificial nests were predated. Fifty percent of the predators were birds, 40% mammals, and 10% remained unknown. The three dominant predators of our artificial nests were the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) with 11 nests and the hooded crow (Corvus corone cornix) and the magpie (Pica pica) with 10 depredated nests each. Our analysis indicates that avian predators preyed upon nests in open fields further away from the forest edge, whereas mammalian predation concentrated closer to the forest edge. Predation occurred more likely at the beginning of the survey and nest survival increased as days passed. Our study highlights the efficiency of using wildlife camera traps in nest predation studies. We also suggest that the ongoing expansion of alien predators across Europe may have a greater impact on ground-nesting bird populations than previously anticipated. © 2018, The Author(s).","Edge effect;

We used three tools (weather surveillance radar, thermal infrared camera, and acoustic recorder) to measure temporal and spatial patterns of nocturnal traffic estimates of flying animals during the spring and fall of 2011 and 2012 in Lewes, Delaware, USA. Our objective was to compare measures among different technologies to better understand their animal detection biases. For radar and thermal imaging, the greatest observed traffic rate tended to occur at, or shortly after, evening twilight, whereas for the acoustic recorder, peak bird flight-calling activity was observed just prior to morning twilight. Comparing traffic rates during the night for all seasons, we found that mean nightly correlations between acoustics and the other two tools were weakly correlated (thermal infrared camera and acoustics, r = 0.004 ±0.04 SE, n = 100 nights; radar and acoustics, r = 0.14 ± 0.04 SE, n = 101 nights), but highly variable on an individual nightly basis (range = -0.84 to 0.92, range = -0.73 to 0.94). The mean nightly correlations between traffic rates estimated by radar and by thermal infrared camera during the night were more strongly positively correlated (r = 0.39 ± 0.04 SE, n = 125 nights), but also were highly variable for individual nights (range = -0.76 to 0.98). Through comparison with radar data among numerous height intervals, we determined that flying animal height above the ground influenced thermal imaging positively and flight call detections negatively. Moreover, thermal imaging detections decreased with the presence of cloud cover and increased with mean ground flight speed of animals, whereas acoustic detections showed no relationship with cloud cover presence but did decrease with increased flight speed. We found sampling methods to be positively correlated when comparing mean nightly traffic rates across nights. The strength of these correlations generally increased throughout the night, peaking 2-3 hours before morning twilight. Given the convergence of measures by different tools at this time, we suggest that researchers consider sampling flight activity in the hours before morning twilight when differences due to detection biases among sampling tools appear to be minimized. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America:.","Acoustic monitoring; Birds; Delaware; Flight calls; Lewes; Migration; NEXRAD; Nocturnal monitoring; Remote-sensing tools; Thermal infrared; Traffic rate; USA; Weather surveillance radar","acoustic method; air transportation; cloud cover; flight activity; migratory species; radar; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner; acoustics; animal; bird; circadian rhythm; flying; infrared radiation; light; physiology; population migration; telecommunication; time; United States; Acoustics; Animal Migration; Animals; Birds; Circadian Rhythm; Delaware; Flight, Animal; Infrared Rays; Light; physiology; physiology; physiology; Radar; Time Factors; East Sussex; England; Lewes; United Kingdom; Animalia; Aves","Ball, S.C., Fall bird migration on the Gaspé Peninsula (1952) Peabody Museum of Natural History Bulletin, 7. , Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, USA; Beier, K., Gemperlein, H., Simulation of infrared detection range at fog conditions for Enhanced Vision Systems in civil aviation (2004) Aerospace Science and Technology, 8, pp. 63-71; (2011) Raven Pro: Interactive Sound Analysis Software.

AI systems have been more far ahead with the recent advances particularity with deep learning that attained state-of-the-art results in almost all Machine Learning (ML) tasks. However, AI systems are venerable but are highly vulnerable which demands timely human intervention. Further, AI systems can easily be tweaked and misguided to produce misleading results that are far from the reality. It is high time to address this susceptibility of AI since reliance on AI systems is keep growing exponentially. AI lacks the key aspect of human intelligence—common sense that guides humans to take better action and decision based on consequences and makes humans more adaptable. This missing aspect of AI inspired the researchers to work toward Artificial general Intelligence (AGI). AGI research involves developing AI systems with human-like consequential and conscious learning. This paper presents the theoretical and practical vulnerability of AI through literature, examples, experiments. The literature and examples concentrates on famous and popular AI systems like deep learning, Google Translate, visual cognition, etc. The experiments are carried out using two datasets; a gene expression dataset for prediction and image dataset for object detection and scene recognition. The experiment results reassert the weakness of AI and the requirement of AGI. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","AGI; Artificial general intelligence; Deep learning","Deep learning; Gene expression; Object detection; Artificial general intelligences; Decision-based; Google translate; Human intelligence; Human intervention; Scene recognition; State of the art; Visual Cognition; Learning systems","Lecun, Y., Predictive learning (2016) Proceedings of the Speech NIPS; Tirumala, S.S., Narayanan, A., Hierarchical data classification using deep neural networks (2015) International Conference on Neural Information Processing, pp. 492-500. , https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-26532-2_54, Springer, Cham), pp; Lecun, Y., Bengio, Y., Hinton, G., Deep learning (2015) Nature, 521 (7553), p. 436; Norouzzadeh, M.S., Nguyen, A., Kosmala, M., Swanson, A., Palmer, M.S., Packer, C., Clune, J., Automatically identifying, counting, and describing wild animals in camera-trap images with deep learning (2018) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences; Ranjan, R., Patel, V.M., Chellappa, R., Hyperface: a deep multi-task learning framework for face detection, landmark localization, pose estimation, and gender recognition (2017) IEEE Trans.

Urbanization in the Anthropocene is now a global process, and squirrels live in affected landscapes. This leads to squirrels adjusting to human developments. Not much is known about the distribution of squirrels and squirrel middens near humans, especially not in the subarctic and sub-urbanized regions. Although this species is hunted, there are no real publicly available distribution and abundance estimates nor management plans and bag limits for squirrels in Alaska or in the United States known by us, except the endangered Mt. Graham squirrel. In general, insufficient squirrel conservation research is carried out; they are underrepresented in research and its literature. To further the science-based management for such species, this study aims to generate the first digital open access workflow as a generic research template for small mammal work including the latest machine learning of open source and high-resolution LIDAR data in an Open Source Geographic Information System (QGIS) and ArcGIS. Machine learning has proven to be less modeler biased and improve accuracy of the analysis outcome, therefore it is the preferred approach. This template is designed to be rapid, simple, robust, generic and effective for being used by a global audience. As a unique showcase, here a squirrel midden survey was carried out for two years (2016 and 2017). These squirrel middens were detected in a research area of 45,5 hectares (0,455 km2) in downtown Fairbanks, interior boreal forest of Alaska, U.S. Transect distances were geo-referenced with a GPS and adjusted to the visual conditions to count all squirrel middens within the survey area. Different layers of proximity to humans and habitat characteristics were assembled using aerial imagery and LIDAR data (3D data needed for an arboreal species like the red squirrels) consisting of a 3 x 3 m resolution. The layer data was used to train a predictive distribution model for red squirrel middens with machine learning. The model showed the relative index of occurrence (RIO) in a map and identified canopy height, distance to trails, canopy density and the distance to a lake, together, as the strongest predictors for squirrel midden distribution whereas open landscape and disturbed areas are avoided. It is concluded that squirrels select for high and dense forests for middens while avoiding human disturbance. This study is able to present a machine learning template to easily and rapidly produce an accurate abundance prediction which can be used for management implications. © 2021 PeerJ Inc..

Working with volunteers recruited by Biosphere Expeditions, wildlife professionals and local rangers, we used direct observation, camera traps, sign surveys (tracks and/or dung) and molecular scatology to study 66 sampling units of 2 × 2 km (grid cells) in an area of 32 × 36 km during a 4-week period in February-March 2011. Sixteen mammal species were recorded, and the largest numbers of species were recorded by sign surveys and camera traps (both n = 9); sign surveys, direct sightings and DNA scatology recorded species across the largest number of grid cells. For species with a sample size large enough for comparison (i.e. detected in ≥ 8 grid cells), DNA scatology proved most effective for detecting caracal Caracal caracal, signs for hyaena Hyaena hyaena, ibex Capra nubiana, porcupine Hystrix indica and hyrax Procavia capensis, and signs and direct sightings for mountain gazelle Gazella gazella. Clustering, in which records from multiple methods are either adjacent or overlapping, was highest (≥ 76%) for the wolf Canis lupus, porcupine, ibex and gazelle. Our results indicate the best methods to detect and record the distributions of individual species in the study area, and demonstrate the advantage of using multiple methods to reduce the risk of false absences or partial detections. Our findings also highlight the potential of clustering as a means of cross-checking results of observations that are skill-dependent, which is particularly useful when employing a large workforce. © Copyright 2016 Fauna & Flora International.","Citizen science; Dhofar; mammals; methods; Middle East; Oman; sampling; volunteer","cluster analysis; detection method; geographical distribution; mammal; mountain region; research work; sampling; trapping; Oman; Zufar; Canis lupus; Capra ibex; Capra nubiana; Caracal caracal; Gazella gazella; Hyaena hyaena hyaena; Hystrix indica; Mammalia; Procavia capensis; Procaviidae","Al Hickmani, H., Zaabanoot, N., Zaabanoot, A., Camera trapping of arabian leopard in the nejd region of dhofar mountains (2015) Cat News, 62, p. 32; Ausband, D.E., Rich, L.N., Glenn, E.M., Mitchell, M.S., Zager, P., Miller, D.A.W., Monitoring gray Wolf populations using multiple survey methods (2014) The Journal of Wildlife Management, 78, pp. 335-346; Balme, G.A., Hunter, L.T.B., Slotow, R., Evaluating methods for counting cryptic carnivores (2009) The Journal of Wildlife Management, 73, pp. 433-441; Boulinier, T., Nichols, J.D., Sauer, J.R., Hines, J.E., Pollock, K.H., Estimating species richness: The importance of heterogeneity in species detectability (1998) Ecology, 79, pp. 1018-1028; Brightsmith, D.J., Stronza, A., Holle, K., Ecotourism, conservation biology, and volunteer tourism: A mutually beneficial triumvirate (2008) Biological Conservation, 141, pp. 2832-2842; Buesching, C.D., Newman, C., MacDonald, D.W., How dear are deer volunteers: The efficiency of monitoring deer using teams of volunteers to conduct pellet group counts (2014) Oryx, 48, pp. 593-601; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., Laake, J., (1980) Estimation of Density from Line Transect Sampling of Biological Populations, , Wildlife Monographs 72.

Despite the often large expense and effort involved in placing detectors in a landscape, there has been relatively little work on how detectors should be located. A natural criterion is to place traps so as to maximize the precision of density estimators, but the lack of a closed-form expression for precision has made optimizing this criterion computationally demanding. Recent results by Efford and Boulanger (2019) show that precision can be well approximated by a function of the expected number of detected individuals and expected number of recapture events, both of which can be evaluated at low computational cost. We use these results to develop a method for obtaining survey designs that optimize this approximate precision for SCR studies using count or binary proximity detectors, or multi-catch traps. We show how the basic design protocol can be extended to incorporate spatially varying distributions of activity centres and animal detectability. We illustrate our approach by simulating from a camera trap study of snow leopards in Mongolia and comparing estimates from our designs to those generated by regular or optimized grid designs. Optimizing detector placement increased the number of detected individuals and recaptures, but this did not always lead to more precise density estimators due to less precise estimation of the effective sampling area. In most cases, the precision of density estimators was comparable to that obtained with grid designs, with improvement in some scenarios where approximate (Formula presented.) < 20% and density varied spatially. Designs generated using our approach are transparent and statistically grounded. They can be produced for survey regions of any shape, adapt to known information about animal density and detectability, and are potentially easier and less costly to implement. We recommend their use as good, flexible candidate designs for SCR surveys when reasonable knowledge of model parameters exists. We provide software for researchers to construct their own designs, in the form of updates to design functions in the r package oSCR. © 2020 British Ecological Society","camera trap; population ecology; sampling; spatial capture-recapture; surveys","","Alexander, J.S., Gopalaswamy, A.M., Shi, K., Riordan, P., Face value: Towards robust estimates of snow leopard densities (2015) PLoS ONE, 10 (8). , https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0134815; Borchers, D.L., Efford, M., Spatially explicit maximum likelihood methods for capture–recapture studies (2008) Biometrics, 64 (2), pp. 377-385. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0420.2007.00927.x; Clark, J.D., Comparing clustered sampling designs for spatially explicit estimation of population density (2019) Population Ecology, 61 (1), pp. 93-101. , https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2580; Dupont, G., Royle, J., Nawaz, M.A., Sutherland, C., Optimal sampling design for spatial capture–recapture (2020) Ecology, , https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.045740v3, (in press).

To recognize animal species without human trackers requires machine learning models that extract specie's features from an image. This project proposes a method of counting animals in an image and specifying the species of each animal using Unet and a variant of the SqueezeNet model. To train the Unet model, images and corresponding masks are used as the training data. Different optimizers are applied to each model. During inference, Unet outputs a binary mask with ones where an animal is detected and zeros elsewhere. SqueezeNet model is trained with images corresponding to six classes: bushbuck, impala, llama, warthog, waterbuck, and zebra. Three variants of the SqueezeNet model have been trained. The first contains the original backbone while the other two have the original backbone with an additional fire module. In one model the Fire module is similar to the Fire modules of the original backbone while in the other model, the extra fire module contains batch normalization layers. The trained models show that Unet trained with Nadam optimizer achieves the highest dice coefficient while the SqueezeNet with an extra Fire module containing batch norm layers and RMSprop optimizer achieves the highest training accuracy. The combined system containing the two models takes an image and outputs the image with bounding boxes around each animal and the corresponding animal species. The system achieves both counting and recognition of the species for each image placed at the input. © 2021 IEEE.","Animals; SqueezeNet; Unet","Computer vision; Mammals; Animal species; Machine learning models; Mammalian species; Model images; Natural habitat; Optimizers; Squeezenet; Training data; Unet; Wild animals; Fires","(2018) Living Planet Report - 2018: Aiming Higher., 26 (4); Prosekov, A., Kuznetsov, A., Rada, A., Ivanova, S., Methods for monitoring large terrestrial animals in the wild (2020) Forests, 11 (8), pp. 1-12; Ingram, D.J., Willcox, D., Challender, D.W.S., Evaluation of the application of methods used to detect and monitor selected mammalian taxa to pangolin monitoring (2019) Glob.

We used generalised linear models to detect trends in probability of occurrence by seven grazing herbivore species using camera trap data. Our results showed that season was a major determinant of species distribution, especially those that are not obligate grazers or feed exclusively in the 0.5 km to 2 km zone from water. We found that most selective feeding occurred in the late wet season when water would be more evenly distributed across the landscape and forage resources close to water would have had the chance to recover from depletion, as a result of dry season use. This has implications for the distribution of artificial water points across the landscape, because areas of reserve forage must be maintained to alleviate grazing pressure close to water. © 2020, © 2020 NISC (Pty) Ltd.","African buffalo; African elephant; Blue wildebeest; extrinsic drivers; forage selection; herbivore distribution; intrinsic traits; Plains zebra; water availability; White rhinoceros","","Archibald, S., African grazing lawns—how fire, rainfall and grazer numbers interact to affect grass community states (2008) The Journal Of Wildlife Management, 72 (2), pp. 492-501. , https://doi.org/10.2193/2007-045; Arsenault, R., Owen-Smith, N., Resource partitioning by grass height among grazing ungulates does not follow body size relation (2008) Oikos, 117 (11), pp. 1711-1717. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2008.16575.x; Bailey, D.W., Gross, J.E., Laca, E.A., Rittenhouse, L.R., Coughenour, M.B., Swift, D.M., Sims, P.L., Mechanisms that result in large herbivore grazing distribution patterns (1996) Journal of Range Management, 49 (5), pp. 386-400. , https://doi.org/10.2307/4002919; Biggs, H.C., Du Toit, J.T., Rodgers, K.H., (2003) The Kruger experience: Ecology and management of savanna heterogeneity, , Washington, USA: Island Press, (Eds; Bonnet, O., Fritz, H., Gignoux, J., Meuret, M., Challenges of foraging on a high-quality, but unpredictable food source: the dynamics of grass production and consumption in savanna grazing lawns (2010) Journal of Ecology, 98 (4), pp. 908-916. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2010.01663.x; Brits, J., Van Rooyen, M.W.V., Van Rooyen, N.V., Ecological impact of large herbivores on the woody vegetation at selected watering points on the eastern basaltic soils in the Kruger National Park (2002) African Journal of Ecology, 40 (1), pp. 53-60. , https://doi.org/10.1046/j.0141-6707.2001.00344.x; Brooke, C.F., Fortin, D., Kraaij, T., Fritz, H., Kalule-Sabiti, M.J., Venter, J.A., Poaching impedes the selection of optimal post-fire forage in three large grazing herbivores (2020) Biological Conservation, 241, p. 108393. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2019.108393; Carbone, C., Christie, S., Conforti, K., Coulson, T., The use of photographic rates to estimate densities of tigers and other cryptic mammals (2001) Animal Conservation Forum, 4 (1), pp. 75-79. , https://doi.org/10.1017/S1367943001001081; Clauss, M., Frey, R., Kiefer, B., Lechner-Doll, M., Loehlein, W., Polster, C., Rössner, G., Streich, W.J., The maximum attainable body size of herbivorous mammals: morphophysiological constraints on foregut and adaptations of hindgut fermenters (2003) Oecologia, 136 (1), pp. 14-27. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-003-1254-z; Clauss, M., Hummel, J., The digestive performance of mammalian herbivores: why big may not be that much better (2005) Mammal Review, 35, pp. 174-187. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2907.2005.00062.x; Codron, D., Lee-Thorp, J.A., Sponheimer, M., Codron, J., de Ruiter, D., Brink, J.S., Significance of diet type and diet quality for ecological diversity of African ungulates (2007) Journal of Animal Ecology, 76 (3), pp. 526-537. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2007.01222.x; Cromsigt, J.P., Veldhuis, M.P., Stock W, D., le Roux, E., Gosling, C.M., Archibald, S., The Functional Ecology of Grazing Lawns: how grazers, termites, people and fire shape HiP’s Savanna Grassland Mosaic.

However, the process of analyzing images through the use of one camera is very sensitive to neighboring environmental factors, such as illumination, background, and noise; thus, it is hard to guarantee precision. To extract proper information from images more precisely in visual sensor networks, this paper proposes an image-switching strategy where, among different types of installed cameras, the one camera best suited to neighboring circumstances is chosen. The proposed strategy is to first receive initial images as input data and then extract multiple features representing neighboring circumstances from the input images. Subsequently, it is to define the neighboring circumstances metric, which is the weighted sum of the extracted features, and to dynamically switch cameras to obtain images in accordance with the neighboring circumstances. The results of the experiment show that the proposed dynamic switching strategy reliably chooses, from among different cameras, the one camera that is best suited to the neighboring circumstances. © 2015 Seok-Woo Jang and Gye-Young Kim.","","Cameras;

Seventy-five photographic beetle records taken with a smartphone camera under “average user” conditions are analysed in terms of correctness of the app’s identification result on various taxonomic levels, the displayed confidence level of the identification and the time until validation of the results. More than 60% of samples were identified correctly at the species level, but only 53% were validated within a month. The mechanisms by which users can upload pictures of their observations to be identified by the artificial intelligence and the validation process by experts are briefly explained. Regional specifics and further opportunities for data usage as well as currently existing problems are discussed and improvements are suggested. The expert validation of records is identified as a huge quality advantage of the Obs-Services. They are generally found to be a promising tool for lay people and professional institutions, despite still existing deficiencies such as identification failure in mutilated specimens, cryptic and rare species, doubtful species rarity ratings as well as the still insufficient capacity of validation. Experts and institutions are encouraged to volunteer as validators and collaborators. © Christian Molls, 2021","artificial intelligence; beetle; citizen science; deep learning; image recognition; nature identification; None","","Beijbom, Edmunds, Roelfsema, Smith, Kline, Neal, Dunlap, Kriegman, Towards automated annotation of benthic survey images: variability of human experts and operational modes of automation (2015) PLoS ONE, 10, p. 0130312. , O PJ C J DI BP M J V T-Y C-J S T A BG & D – doi 1371/journalpone0130312; Engel, Ceríaco, Daniel, Dellapé, Löbl, Marinov, Reis, Zacharie, The taxonomic impediment: a shortage of taxonomists, not the lack of technical approaches (2021) Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 193, pp. 381-387. , M S LMP GM PM I M RE MT A I PA M N F K JS D D SA P DA L FA W A CRF S SM A S MJM JV G LM SR CAS T SF J H AW G FM V E IA I J S A PHF JD V MP JWM RC LF S K A V H J D OSG MO LB PDP L J C M-O MT SM H Í A M BS MM AC P P J-F CV-D K CJ G P T JL S & CK – – doi 101093/zoolinnean/zlab072/6374389; GomezVilla, Salazar, Vargas, Towards automatic wild animal monitoring: Identification of animal species in camera-trap images using very deep convolutional neural networks (2017) Ecological Informatics, 41, pp. :24-32. , A A & F – – doi 101016/jecoinf07004; Hedrick, Heberling, Meineke, Turner, Grassa, Park, Kennedy, Davis, Digitization and the future of natural history collections (2020) BioScience, 70, pp. 243-251. , BP JM EK KG CJ DS J JA JA DC SV & CC – – doi 101093/biosci/biz163; Hochkirch, Samways, Gerlach, Böhm, Williams, Cardoso, Cumberlidge, Dijkstra, A strategy for the next decade to address data deficiency in neglected biodiversity (2020) Conservation Biology, 35, pp. 502-509. , A MJ J M PH P N PJ M V P GM P DT A & KD – – doi 101111/cobi189; Kaufmann, Lindner, Biodiversitätsdaten, Citizen Science und Online-Erfassungssysteme — Überblick und Erfahrungsbericht (2021) Anliegen Natur, 43, pp. 93-100. , P & R – –; Kerstes, Breeschoten, Kalkman, Schilthuizen, Snail shell colour evolution in urban heat islands detected via citizen science (2019) Communications Biology, 2, p. 264. , NAG T VJ & M – doi 101038/s4003-019-0511-6; Laufer, Höppner, Nöllert, 3.9 Gelbbauch unke (Bombina variegata). – Rote-Liste-Gremium Amphibien und Reptilien: Rote Liste und Gesamtartenliste der Amphibien (Amphibia) Deutschlands (2020) Naturschutz und Biologische Vielfalt, 170, pp. 42-43. , L C & A – – doi 1019213/972174/; LeCun, Bengio, Hinton, Deep learning (2015) Nature, 521, pp. 436-444. , Y Y & G – – doi 101038/nature14539; Partners (2021), https://observation.org/pages/partners/, Observation International –; Oncevay-Marcos, Juarez-Chambi, Khlebnikov-Núñez, Beltrán-Castañón, Azzopardi, Petkov, Leaf-based plant identification through morphological characterization in digital images (2015) Computer Analysis of Images and Patterns.

Tapirs are hunted in French Guiana, although a law introduced in 2011 restricts hunting to one animal per person per hunting trip. We carried out camera-trap surveys in the Nouragues Nature Reserve for 4 years, with the goal of estimating tapir densities in undisturbed conditions and determining sustainable harvest levels for tapirs in French Guiana. We analysed our data with a Bayesian spatially explicit capture-recapture model, with parameter sharing across surveys to improve estimates, and used the model to calculate derived parameters such as maximum sustainable harvest levels. Density estimates for all four surveys were similar and the model indicated a difference in encounter rates for the two camera models used but no difference in encounter rates or home range sizes for males and females or between years. Based on the calculated density of 0.32 tapir km-2 we estimated sustainable harvest levels at 0.009 tapir km-2. Comparing this value to hunting surveys from 11 sites between 1999 and 2006, we found that hunting levels were unsustainable in at least seven villages. We conclude that even the new restrictive hunting law will not prevent overhunting of tapirs in certain areas and thus stronger regulations are needed. However, because of the remoteness of tapir habitat in many parts of French Guiana tapirs are not immediately threatened in the country as a whole.

For this last application, specifically, through the acquisition of very high resolution images taken with two UAS-borne compact cameras (RGB and NIR), a DSM of a small vegetated area and the corresponding orthoimages were produced and co-registered. Planimetric and height accuracies in block adjustments and orthophotos are in the range of 0.10 m horizontally and 0.15 m in height. Then, after the derivation of synthetic channels, both unsupervised classification and supervised one were performed in order to test the algorithms' ability to distinguish between different bushes and trees species: some of them were correctly classified by the latter method but misclassifications still remain. The overall accuracy for the unsupervised classification is about 50% while the supervised one yields an overall accuracy around 80%.","Block adjustment; Classification; DSM; Orthophoto; UAS; Vegetation","3D modeling; Antennas; Classification (of information); Forestry; Stereo image processing; Surveys; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; Block adjustment; Interactive Environments; Ortho photos; Overall accuracies; Unmanned aerial systems; Unsupervised classification; Vegetation monitoring; Very high resolution (VHR) image; Flight dynamics; accuracy assessment; algorithm; classification; spectral analysis; three-dimensional modeling; vegetation structure; videography; Classification; Forestry; Information Retrieval; Plants; Italy","Ackermann, F., Tsingas, V., Automatic Digital Aerial Triangulation (1994) Proceedings of the American Society For Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, pp. 1-12. , Annual Convention, Reno; Alba, M., Barazzetti, L., Giussani, A., Roncoroni, F., Scaioni, M., Filtering vegetation from terrestrial point clouds with low-cost near infrared cameras (2011) Italian Journal of Remote Sensing, 43, pp. 55-75. , http://dx.doi.org/10.5721/ItJRS20114325; Barazzetti, L., Remondino, F., Scaioni, M., Fully automated UAV image-based sensor orientation (2010) International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, 38, p. 1. , Calgary, Canada (on CD-ROM); Berni, J.A.J., Zarco-Tejada, P.J., Suárez, L., Fereres, E., Thermal and narrowband multispectral remote sensing for vegetation monitoring from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (2009) IEEE Transactions On Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 47 (3), pp. 722-738. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.2010457; Brivio, P.A., Lechi, G., Zilioli, E., (2006) Principi E Metodi Di Telerilevamento, p. 525. , CittàStudi (Eds), Utet, Torino, ISBN: 88-251-7293-1; Brown, D.C., Close-Range Camera Calibration (1971) Photogrammetric Engineering, 37 (8), pp. 855-866; Celesti-Grapow, L., Alessandrini, A., Arrigoni, P.V., Assini, S., Banfi, E., Barni, E., Bovio, M., Blasi, C., Non-native flora of Italy: Species distribution and threats (2010) Plant Biosystems, 144 (1), pp. 12-28. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11263500903431870; Congalton, R.G., A review of assessing the accuracy of classifications of remotely sensed data (1991) Remote Sensing of Environment, 37, pp. 35-46. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0034-4257(91)90048-B; Congalton, R.G., Green, K., (2008) Assessing the Accuracy of Remotely Sensed Data: Principles and Practices, p. 180. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1201/9781420055139, Taylor & Francis Group, Boca Raton; Eisenbeiss, H., (2009) UAV Photogrammetry, p. 235. , Ph.D. thesis, Diss.

The random encounter model, developed by Rowcliffe et al. (J Anal Ecol 45(4):1228–1236, 2008), estimates animal density from camera-trap data without the need to identify animals. Although the REM can provide reliable density estimates, it lacks the potential to account for the multiple sources of variance in the modelling process. The density estimator in REM is a ratio, and since the variance of a ratio estimator is intractable, we examine and compare the finite sample performance of many approaches for obtaining confidence intervals via simulation studies. We also propose an integrated random encounter model as a parametric alternative, which is flexible and can incorporate covariates and random effects. A data example from Whipsnade Wild Animal Park, Bedfordshire, south England, is used to demonstrate the application of these methods.

These endeavors are a focus of many other disciplines, leading to widespread sharing of general methodologies. Wildlife professionals have appropriately borrowed and assimilated many methods developed primarily in other disciplines but have also led the development of one class of quantitative methods, those that confront and incorporate uncertainty. Uncertainty arises in counts of focal entities, for which wildlife professionals have developed effective methods to deal with the common problems of nondetection and misclassification. These methods have been borrowed by disciplines as varied as paleobiology, medicine, human epidemiology, industrial quality control, military target acquisition, remote sensing, and human census. Uncertainty also arises in the modeling of those counts, specifically the observation and ecological processes that generated them. Wildlife professionals recognized the fundamental importance of model selection and rapidly assimilated methods for selecting the most appropriate model for a given data set. These methods for dealing with uncertainty inherent to counting and modeling are critical to the conduct of science and management. Wildlife professionals have developed additional methods for incorporating uncertainty in the accumulation of knowledge and the development of optimal decisions in an environment of learning. In some cases, professionals in other disciplines are using methods developed and popularized in the wildlife profession, but there is much potential for greater use. In this essay, I describe these areas of wildlife leadership, document their assimilation by other disciplines, and emphasize the potential for more interdisciplinary use of these methods. © 2019 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2019","counts; interdisciplinary; management; models; quantitative methods; science; uncertainty; wildlife profession","applied science; data set; integrated approach; interdisciplinary approach; knowledge; methodology; model; modeling; quantitative analysis; uncertainty analysis; wildlife management","Adams, M.J., Chelgren, N.D., Reinitz, D., Cole, R.A., Rachowicz, L.J., Galvan, S., McCreary, B., Leu, M., Using occupancy models to understand the distribution of an amphibian pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (2010) Ecological Applications, 20, pp. 289-302; Amstrup, S.C., McDonald, T.L., Manly, B.F.J., (2005) Handbook of capture-recapture methods, , editors., Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, USA; Anderson, D.R., Optimal exploitation strategies for an animal population in a Markovian environment—theory and an example (1975) Ecology, 56, pp. 1281-1297; Anderson, R.M., May, R.M., (1991) Infectious diseases of humans: dynamics and control, , Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom; Arnason, A.N., The estimation of population size, migration rates, and survival in a stratified population (1973) Researches on Population Ecology, 15, pp. 1-8; Astrom, K.J., Optimal control of Markov processes with incomplete state information (1965) Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications, 10, pp. 174-205; Bailey, L.L., MacKenzie, D.I., Nichols, J.D., Advances and applications of occupancy models (2014) Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 2014, pp. 1269-1279; Bailey, N.T.J., (1975) The mathematical theory of infectious diseases, , 2nd edition, Macmillan, London, United Kingdom; Barker, R.J., Link, W.A., Bayesian multimodel inference by RJMCMC: a Gibbs sampling approach (2013) American Statistician, 67, pp. 150-156; Begley, C.G., Ioannidis, J.P.A., Reproducibility in science: Improving the standard for basic and preclinical research (2015) Circulation Research, 116, pp. 116-126; Bellman, R., (1957) Dynamic programming, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, USA; Besbeas, P., Freeman, S.N., Morgan, B.J.T., Catchpole, E.A., Integrating mark-recapture-recovery and census data to estimate animal abundance and demographic parameters (2002) Biometrics, 58, pp. 540-547; Beverton, R.J.H., Holt, S.J., (1957) On the dynamics of exploited fish populations, , Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London, United Kingdom; Bogich, T.L., Anthony, S.J., Nichols, J.D., Surveillance theory applied to virus detection: a case for targeted discovery (2013) Future Virology, 8, pp. 1201-1206; Brett, C.E., Sequence stratigraphy, paleoecology, and evolution; biotic clues and responses to sea-level fluctuations (1998) Palaios, 13, pp. 241-262; Brooks, S.P., Catchpole, E.A., Morgan, B.J.T., Harris, M.P., Bayesian methods for analyzing ringing data (2002) Journal of Applied Statistics, 29, pp. 187-206; Brownie, C., Anderson, D.R., Burnham, K.P., Robson, D.S., (1978) Statistical inference from band recovery data - a handbook.

Gathering these metrics is a slow and laborious process, quantified by an expert manually sorting and weighing arthropod specimens. We present a tool to accelerate bulk arthropod classification and biomass estimates utilizing machine learning methods for computer vision. Our approach requires pre-sorted arthropod samples to create a training dataset. We construct a dataset considering 18 terrestrial arthropod functional groups collected in southern Ontario, Canada. The dataset contains 517 high-resolution images with approximately 20 individuals per image taken from either a petri dish or a bulk tray. Our tool uses the watershed algorithm to obtain precisely cropped individuals without any object annotations. After manually sorting cropped images of biological ‘debris’ and petri dish edges, three classifiers, DenseNet121, ResNet101 and MobileNetv2, each with trade-offs of computational efficiency versus accuracy, are trained and compared to predict arthropod functional groups for each cropped individual. To calculate biomass, we compare seven linear and nonlinear models considering the arthropod pixel masks obtained using the watershed algorithm, in combination with images of a single function group with recorded weights, to calculate the per pixel density per functional group. From our experimentation, we recommend using DenseNet121 as it had the highest top-1 functional group classification accuracy, likely a result of being the model with the largest number of parameters, with 86.14% considering the 20 labelled classes (18 arthropods plus debris and petri dish edge) in comparison to ResNet101 (85.10%) and MobileNetv2 (84.94%). For biomass estimation, we recommend using the average per pixel density which had the highest ranked performance considering both total error, 0.043 g (0.855% error), and cumulative class-specific error, 1.62 g (40.67% average error across all classes), in comparison to the total ground truth biomass of 5.10 g. Our estimated Simpson's Index of Diversity was 0.9404 in comparison to the ground truth 0.9408. Our method simultaneously classifies >1,000 arthropods to functional groupings while estimating total and class specific biomass, without any computer vision bounding box or mask annotations, all from a single photo. We release our code and dataset to further research efforts in computer vision for arthropod classification. © 2021 British Ecological Society","","","Bianco, S., Cadene, R., Celona, L., Napoletano, P., Benchmark analysis of representative deep neural network architectures (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 64270-64277. , https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877890; Borer, E.T., Seabloom, E.W., Tilman, D., Plant diversity controls arthropod biomass and temporal stability (2012) Ecology Letters, 15 (12), pp. 1457-1464. , https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.12006; Bradski, G., Kaehler, A., Opencv (2000) Dr. Dobb's Journal of Software Tools, 3 (120), pp. 122-125; Burgess, P., Betini, G., Cholewka, A., deWaard, J.R., deWaard, S.L., Griswold, C., Hebert, P.D.N., Fryxell, J.M., Plant community restoration along farm field margins compensates for negative effects of agricultural intensification on arthropod biodiversity (2022) Journal of Applied Ecology, , In review; Cao, X., Wei, Z., Gao, Y., Huo, Y., Recognition of common insect in field based on deep learning (2020) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1634; deWaard, J.R., Levesque-Beaudin, V., deWaard, S.L., Ivanova, N.V., McKeown, J.T.A., Miskie, R., Naik, S., Hebert, P.D.N., Expedited assessment of terrestrial arthropod diversity by coupling Malaise traps with DNA barcoding (2019) Genome, 62 (3), pp. 85-95. , https://doi.org/10.1139/gen-2018-0093; Free, J.B., (1993) Insect pollination of crops, , 2nd ed., Academic Press; https://biodiversitygenomics.net/projects/gmp/, Retrieved from; Hallmann, C.A., Sorg, M., Jongejans, E., Siepel, H., Hofland, N., Schwan, H., Stenmans, W., de Kroon, H., More than 75 percent decline over 27 years in total flying insect biomass in protected areas (2017) PLoS ONE, 12 (10). , https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0185809; He, K., Gkioxari, G., Dollár, P., Girshick, R., Mask r-cnn (2017) Proceedings of the IEEE international conference on computer vision, pp. 2961-2969. , E.

In this paper, we focus on wildlife monitoring and analysis through animal detection from natural scenes acquired by camera-trap networks. The image sequences obtained from camera-trap consist of highly cluttered images that hinder the detection of animal resulting in low-detection rates and high false discovery rates. To handle this problem, we have used a camera-trap database that has candidate animal proposals using multilevel graph cut in the spatiotemporal domain. These proposals are used to create a verification phase that identifies whether a given patch is animal or background. We have designed animal detection model using self-learned Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) features. This efficient feature set is then used for classification using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, namely support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and ensemble tree. Our intensive results show that our detection model using DCNN features provides accuracy of 91.4% on standard camera-trap dataset. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.","Animal detection; Camera-trap images; DCNN features; Deep learning; Ensemble tree; KNN; SVM","Animals; Cameras; Computer vision; Convolution; Deep learning; Feature extraction; Forestry; Graphic methods; Learning algorithms; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Cluttered images; DCNN features; Deep convolutional neural networks; Ensemble trees; False discovery rate; K-nearest neighbors; Spatio-temporal domains; Wildlife monitoring; Deep neural networks","Tilak, S., Monitoring wild animal communities with arrays of motion sensitive camera (2011) Int.

Traditional methods of monitoring visitors through on-site observation and surveys can be time consuming, expensive, and prone to error, and park managers recognize the value of new technologies in providing reliable and cost-effective visitor monitoring programs that achieve a balance between precision, accuracy, and efficiency. Live webcam video feeds are becoming increasingly available online and provide an opportunity to monitor aspects of recreation that have previously been difficult to measure. Additionally, webcam monitoring, which can be done remotely, provides a cost-effective alternative to on-site data collection because it eliminates the need for travel costs and on-site personnel. The purpose of this study is to provide a methodological investigation of ex-tracting recreation data from webcams to introduce park managers and leisure researchers to this new data collection technique. We provide a typology for the types of questions this method can address, carefully document an approach for conducting research with webcam video feeds, and provide a proof-of-principle through presenting a case study. Taken together, we demonstrate that an online approach using webcam footage for recreation research is feasible and viable. This research has broad applications in recreation contexts, allowing the study of detailed spatio-temporal recreation patterns, visit volumes, user heterogeneity, and large tour tracking. Webcam information can also be combined with relevant data on weather conditions, air quality, gas prices, or other conditions to learn about factors shaping the timing of recreation experiences. This study has implications for park and recreation managers, who make decisions about facilitating or hindering the use of webcams at their sites through their attention to expanding or contracting the supply of webcams on public lands, positioning cameras, and maintaining live feeds. Decisions made by park staff about webcams should not only consider the impacts of webcams on enhancing user experience, but also consider their use as a tool to monitor recreation patterns by park personnel and by leisure and tourism researchers more broadly. © 2021, Sagamore Publishing LLC.

In reality, this failed to materialize, arguably as a consequence of practical challenges in studying organisms at night and instead concentrating on the existence of circadian rhythms, the mechanisms that give rise to them, and their consequences. This legacy is evident to this day, with consideration of the ecology of the nighttime markedly underrepre-sented in ecological research and literature. However, several factors suggest that it would be timely to revive the vision of a comprehensive research program in nighttime ecology. These include (i) that the study of the ecology of the night is being revolutionized by new and improved technologies; (ii) suggestions that, far from being a minor component of biodiversity, a high proportion of animal species are active at night; (iii) that fundamental questions about differences and connections between the ecology of the daytime and the nighttime remain largely unanswered; and (iv) that the nighttime environment is coming under severe anthropogenic pressure. In this article, I seek to reestablish nighttime ecology as a synthetic program of research, highlighting key focal topics and questions and providing an overview of the current state of understanding and developments. © 2019 by The University of Chicago.","Activity; Diel; Ecosystems; Macroecology; Nighttime; Nocturnal; Time partitioning","activity pattern; animal community; biodiversity; diel variation; ecosystem approach; macroecology; nocturnal activity; research program; Animalia; animal; circadian rhythm; ecology; ecosystem; Animals; Circadian Rhythm; Ecology; Ecosystem","Agetsuma, N., Koda, R., Tsujino, R., Agetsuma-Yanagihara, Y., Impact of anthropogenic disturbance on the density and activity pattern of deer evaluated with respect to spatial scale-dependency (2016) Mammalian Biology, 81, pp. 130-137; Aguzzi, J., Bahamon, N., Modeled day-night biases in decapod assessment by bottom trawling survey (2009) Fisheries Research, 100, pp. 274-280; Alberti, M., Correa, C., Marzluff, J.M., Hendry, A.P., Palkovacs, E.P., Gotanda, K.M., Hunt, V.M., Zhou, Y., Global urban signatures of phenotypic change in animal and plant populations (2017) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 114, pp. 8951-8956; Alberti, M., Marzluff, J., Hunt, V.M., Urban driven phenotypic changes: Empirical observations and theoretical implications for eco-evolutionary feedback (2016) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 372; Albrecht, M., Gotelli, N.J., Spatial and temporal niche partitioning in grassland ants (2001) Oecologia, 126, pp. 134-141; Alkon, P.U., Saltz, D., Foraging time and the northern range limits of the Indian crested porcupine (Hystrix indica Kerr) (1988) Journal of Biogeography, 15, pp. 403-408; Alós, J., Palmer, M., Arlinghaus, R., Consistent selection towards low activity phenotypes when catchability depends on encounters among human predators and fish (2012) Plos ONE, 7; Altermatt, F., Ebert, D., Reduced flight-to-light behaviour of moth populations exposed to long-term urban light pollution (2016) Biology Letters, 12; Alward, R.D., Detling, J.K., Milchunas, D.G., Grassland vegetation changes and nocturnal global warming (1999) Science, 283, pp. 229-231; Anderegg, W.R.L., Ballantyne, A.P., Smith, W.K., Majkut, J., Rabin, S., Beaulieu, C., Birdsey, R., Tropical nighttime warming as a dominant driver of variability in the terrestrial carbon sink (2015) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 112; Anderson, S.R., Wiens, J.J., Out of the dark: 350 million years of conservatism and evolution in diel activity patterns in vertebrates (2017) Evolution, 44, pp. 554-616; Ankel-Simons, F., Rasmussen, D.T., Diurnality, nocturnality, and the evolution of primate visual systems (2008) American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 137, pp. 100-117; Arrington, D.A., Winemiller, K.O., Diel changeover in sandbank fish assemblages in a Neotropical floodplain river (2003) Journal of Fish Biology, 63, pp. 442-459; Austin, V.I., Ribot, R.F.H., Bennett, A.T.D., If waterbirds are nocturnal are we conserving the right habitats?

The classification of animals are done by training and subsequently testing two different machine learning techniques, namely k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Computer-assisted technique when applied through parallel computing makes the work efficient by reducing the time taken for the task of animal recognition and classification. Here we propose a parallel algorithm for the same. Experimentation is done for about 30 different classes of animals containing more than 3000 images.

We investigated exploitation of the underground nests of stingless bees (Meliplebeia lendliana) by three sympatric consumers in Loango National Park, Gabon: the central African chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes), forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) and honey badger (Mellivora capensis). Given the differences in their respective morphological traits and sensory abilities, we hypothesized that chimpanzees would be more limited in digging out the bee nests, compared to the other two competitors, and would show behavioral strategies to overcome such constraints. Our dataset comprised camera trap footage recorded over 60 mo at 100 different bee nests. Chimpanzees visited the nests more often than the other consumers, showing a frequency of extraction success comparable to that observed in honey badgers, the most efficient digger. Both chimpanzees and honey badgers increased their extractive attempts across the dry season, whereas elephants did not. The soil hardness was greater during the dry season than the wet season and, possibly in order to compensate for this, chimpanzees showed a tendency toward digging at nests found in relatively softer soil. They also seemed to be inhibited by indirect cues left by other consumers, possibly as a risk-avoidance strategy. Overall, chimpanzees and honey badgers extracted the underground nests of stingless bees with similar frequencies, whilst forest elephants did so only occasionally. Moreover, chimpanzees can use tools and other behavioral strategies to overcome the physical limitations that may constrain their exploitation of this resource. © 2016 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation","camera trapping; community ecology; honey consumption; Loxodonta cyclotis; Mellivora capensis; Pan troglodytes troglodytes; stingless bees; tool use","bee; behavioral response; community ecology; dry season; elephant; exploitation; feeding behavior; honey; morphology; mustelid; nest site; photogrammetry; primate; soft soil; tool use; wet season; Gabon; Loango National Park; Ogooue Maritime; Animalia; Apoidea; Elephantidae; Loxodonta cyclotis; Meliplebeia; Meliponinae; Mellivora capensis; Pan; Pan troglodytes troglodytes","Baayen, R.H., (2008) Analyzing linguistic data, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, U.K; Barr, D.J., Levy, R., Scheepers, C., Tily, H.J., Random effects structure for confirmatory hypothesis testing: keep it maximal (2013) J.
