Camera trapping has some major advantages over other trapping methods, such as pitfall traps, because cameras can be left in the field for extended periods of time. However, there is still a need to compare traditional trapping methods with newer techniques. Aims: To compare trap rates, species richness and community composition of small mammals and reptiles by using passive, unbaited camera traps and pitfall traps. Methods: We directly compared pitfall trapping (20-L buried buckets) with downward-facing infrared-camera traps (Reconyx) to survey small reptiles and mammals at 16 sites within a forested habitat in south-Western Australia. We compared species captured using each method, as well as the costs associated with each. Key results: Overall, we recorded 228 reptiles, 16 mammals and 1 frog across 640 pitfall trap-nights (38.3 animal captures per 100 trap-nights) compared to 271 reptiles and 265 mammals (for species likely to be captured in pitfall traps) across 2572 camera trap nights (20.8 animal captures per 100 trap-nights). When trap effort is taken into account, camera trapping was only 23% as efficient as pitfall trapping for small reptiles (mostly Scincidae), but was five times more efficient for surveying small mammals (Dasyuridae). Comparing only those species that were likely to be captured in pitfall traps, 13 species were recorded by camera trapping compared with 20 species recorded from pitfall trapping∼ however, we found significant (P < 0.001) differences in community composition between the methods. In terms of cost efficacy, camera trapping was the more expensive method for our short, 4-month survey when taking the cost of cameras into consideration. Conclusions: Applicability of camera trapping is dependent on the specific aims of the intended research. Camera trapping is beneficial where community responses to ecosystem disturbance are being tested. Live capture of small reptiles via pitfall trapping allows for positive species identification, morphological assessment, and collection of reference photos to help identify species from camera photos. Implications: As stand-alone techniques, both survey methods under-represent the available species present in a region. The use of more than one survey method improves the scope of fauna community assessments. © 2019 CSIRO.","Antechinus; camera trapping; Elliott traps; live trapping; Pogona minor; Sminthopsis; survey techniques","community composition; community response; comparative study; detection method; disturbance; frog; habitat type; pitfall trap; reptile; small mammal; species richness; survey method; trap (equipment); trapping; Australia; Western Australia; Animalia; Antechinus; Anura; Dasyuridae; Mammalia; Pogona minor; Reptilia; Scincidae; Sminthopsis","Ariefiandy, A., Purwandana, D., Seno, A., Ciofi, C., Jessop, T.S., Can camera traps monitor komodo dragons a large ectothermic predator?

The behavior of fish around baited gears, however, is poorly understood despite its importance for estimating catchability. We used a fine-scale acoustic positioning system to elucidate the movement behaviors of 11 telemetered gray triggerfish Balistes capriscus around 54 baited fish traps deployed at a 37 m deep site in Raleigh Bay, North Carolina, USA. Median positional error rates from a reference transmitter were 1-2 m, suggesting fish positions were accurate and precise. Overall, 104 170 spatial positions were determined for gray triggerfish over the 42 d study. There were 27 instances of telemetered gray triggerfish responding to baited fish traps. These fish responded from initial distances up to 312 m (mean = 68 m) from traps and spent 4-95% (mean = 35%) of their time within 20 m of traps. Using generalized additive models, we determined that telemetered gray triggerfish were most likely to respond to baited traps when they were initially located close to (<100 m), and down-current from, baited traps. There were substantial differences in gray triggerfish responses and water clarity across the 3 recapture periods, suggesting gray triggerfish use vision, olfaction, and perhaps sound to locate bait. Our modeling approach is general, and could be used to quantify the behavior of myriad organisms around sampling gears in various types of aquatic systems. © Inter-Research 2018.","Animal behavior; Bait; Baited remote underwater video station; BRUVS; Movement; Reef; Telemetry; Trap; Vemco positioning system","animal; bait; behavioral ecology; bioacoustics; catchability; finfish; movement; positioning system; reef; tracking; trap (equipment); underwater environment; North Carolina; United States; Animalia; Balistes capriscus","Ault, J.S., Bohnsack, J.A., Smith, S.G., Luo, J., Towards sustainable multispecies fisheries in the Florida USA coral reef ecosystem (2005) Bull Mar Sci, 76, pp. 595-622; Bacheler, N.M., Smart, T.I., Multi-decadal decline of reef fish abundance and species richness in the Southeast United States assessed by standardized trap catches (2016) Mar Biol, 163, p. 26; Bacheler, N.M., Berrane, D.J., Mitchell, W.A., Schobernd, C.M., Schobernd, Z.H., Teer, B.Z., Ballenger, J.C., Environmental conditions and habitat characteristics influence trap and video detection probabilities for reef fish species (2014) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 517, pp. 1-14; Bacheler, N.M., Whitfield, P.E., Muñoz, R.C., Harrison, B.B., Harms, C.A., Buckel, C.A., Movement of invasive adult lion-fish pterois volitans using telemetry: Importance of controls to estimate and explain variable detection probabilities (2015) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 527, pp. 205-220; Bacheler, N.M., Geraldi, N.R., Burton, M.L., Muñoz, R.C., Kellison, G.T., Comparing relative abundance, lengths, and habitat of temperate reef fishes using simultaneous underwater video census, video, and trap sampling (2017) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 574, pp. 141-155; Bozec, Y.M., Kulbicki, M., Laloë, F., Mou-Tham, G., Gascuel, D., Factors affecting the detection distances of reef fish: Implications for visual counts (2011) Mar Biol, 158, pp. 969-981; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (2002) Model Selection and Multi Model Inference: A Practical Information-theoretic Approach, , 2nd edn.

We investigated species diversity in Wanglang National Nature Reserve using camera traps. We conducted vegetation surveys and obtained topographic information at each camera trapping site. We determined the characteristic species of trees and wildlife at each site using PCA. Generalized Linear Models of the effect of landscape structure (including the terrain and vegetation) and co-occurrence of wildlife species on occurrence of characteristic species were compared. Model selection showed that the global model out-performed all other models. The effect of species co-occurrence explained the most variation in species occurrence, while terrain and dominant tree species also had explained a high proportion. The co-occurrence of wildlife is affected by the distribution of terrain-dependent vegetation and dominant tree species, especially in the case of arboreal animals, which implies a high degree of niche partitioning. In contrast, terrestrial animals are more affected by species co-occurrence. Obvious mutual exclusivity is shown between grazing livestock (e.g. the cattle) and medium-to-large mammals such as giant panda and tufted deer. This may be attributed to the complete niche differentiation between these species, and indicates the effects of anthropogenic activities on wildlife in the reserve. These results indicate that the maintenance of a complex landscape is helpful for maintaining diverse resources and niches for wildlife. Reducing or adequately managing grazing activity is urgent for protecting medium- and large-sized mammals in the reserve. © 2019 The Authors","Giant panda grazing livestock; Interspecific disturbance; Landscape effect; Niche partitioning; Species co-occurrence; Wanglang national nature reserve","","Alexander, J.S., Zhang, C., Shi, K., Riordan, P., A granular view of a snow leopard population using camera traps in Central China (2016) Biol.

We developed AnimalFinder in MATLAB® to identify animal presence in time-lapse camera trap images by comparing individual photos to all images contained within the subset of images (i.e. photos from the same survey and site), with some manual processing required to remove false positives and collect other relevant data (species, sex, etc.). We tested AnimalFinder on a set of camera trap images and compared the presence/absence results with manual-only review with white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), wild pigs (Sus scrofa), and raccoons (Procyon lotor). We compared abundance estimates, model rankings, and coefficient estimates of detection and abundance for white-tailed deer using N-mixture models. AnimalFinder performance varied depending on a threshold value that affects program sensitivity to frequently occurring pixels in a series of images. Higher threshold values led to fewer false negatives (missed deer images) but increased manual processing time, but even at the highest threshold value, the program reduced the images requiring manual review by ~ 40% and correctly identified > 90% of deer, raccoon, and wild pig images. Estimates of white-tailed deer were similar between AnimalFinder and the manual-only method (~ 1–2 deer difference, depending on the model), as were model rankings and coefficient estimates. Our results show that the program significantly reduced data processing time and may increase efficiency of camera trapping surveys. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Animal detection; Camera trap; Game camera; Image processing; N-mixture model; Wildlife monitoring","abundance; automation; biomonitoring; canid; data processing; deer; detection method; ecological modeling; image processing; pig; software; videography; wildlife management; Animalia; Cervidae; Odocoileus virginianus; Procyon; Procyon lotor; Suidae; Sus scrofa","Adams, J.D., Speakman, T., Zolman, E., Schwacke, L.H., Automating image matching, cataloging, and analysis for photo-identification research (2006) Aquat.

The precision of density estimates depends fundamentally on the number and spatial configuration of traps. Despite this knowledge, existing sampling design recommendations are heuristic and their performance remains untested for most practical applications. To address this issue, we propose a genetic algorithm that minimizes any sensible, criteria-based objective function to produce near-optimal sampling designs. To motivate the idea of optimality, we compare the performance of designs optimized using three model-based criteria related to the probability of capture. We use simulation to show that these designs outperform those based on existing recommendations in terms of bias, precision, and accuracy in the estimation of population size. Our approach, available as a function in the R package oSCR, allows conservation practitioners and researchers to generate customized and improved sampling designs for wildlife monitoring. © 2020 by the Ecological Society of America","camera traps; density; genetic algorithm; optimal design; sampling design; SCR; spatial capture–recapture; spatial sampling; spatially explicit capture–recapture; trap spacing","genetic algorithm; mark-recapture method; population density; precision; sampling; simulation; computer simulation; human; population density; Computer Simulation; Humans; Population Density","Bondrup-Nielsen, S., Density estimation as a function of live-trapping grid and home range size (1983) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 61, pp. 2361-2365; Borchers, D.L., Efford, M.G., Spatially explicit maximum likelihood methods for capture–recapture studies (2008) Biometrics, 64, pp. 377-385; Dillon, A., Kelly, M.J., Ocelot Leopardus pardalis in Belize: the impact of trap spacing and distance moved on density estimates (2007) Oryx, 41, pp. 469-477; Durbach, I., Borchers, D.L., Sutherland, C., Sharma, K., Fast, flexible alternatives to regular grid designs for spatial capture–recapture (2020) Methods in Ecology and Evolution, pp. 1-13. , http//org/101111/2041-210x.13517; Efford, M., Density estimation in live-trapping studies (2004) Oikos, 106, pp. 598-610; Efford, M.G., Boulanger, J., Fast evaluation of study designs for spatially explicit capture–recapture (2019) Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 10, pp. 1529-1535; Efford, M.G., Fewster, R.M., Estimating population size by spatially explicit capture–recapture (2013) Oikos, 122, pp. 918-928; Fabiano, E.C., Sutherland, C., Fuller, A.K., Nghikembua, M., Eizirik, E., Marker, L., Trends in cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) density in north-central Namibia (2020) Population Ecology, 62, pp. 233-243; Fuller, A.K., Sutherland, C.S., Royle, J.A., Hare, M.P., Estimating population density and connectivity of American mink using spatial capture–recapture (2016) Ecological Applications, 26, pp. 1125-1135; Goldberg, D., (1989) Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization, and Machine Learning, pp. 1-22. , Pages, Addison-Wesley Professional, Reading, Massachusetts, USA; (2019) R: A language and environment for statistical computing, , R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria, www.r-project.org; Rich, L.N., Miller, D.A., Munoz, D.J., Robinson, H.S., McNutt, J.W., Kelly, M.J., Sampling design and analytical advances allow for simultaneous density estimation of seven sympatric carnivore species from camera trap data (2019) Biological Conservation, 233, pp. 12-20; Royle, J.A., Chandler, R.B., Sollmann, R., Gardner, B., (2014) Spatial capture–recapture, , Academic Press/Elsevier, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA; Sciaini, M., Fritsch, M., Scherer, C., Simpkins, C.E., Nlmr and landscapetools: An integrated environment for simulating and modifying neutral landscape models in r (2018) Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 9, pp. 2240-2248; Sollmann, R., Gardner, B., Belant, J.L., How does spatial study design influence density estimates from spatial capture–recapture models?

For models to be useful, they must be based on data that best represent the presence or abundance of the species. Data used as inputs in the development of these models can be obtained through numerous methods, each subject to different biases and limitations but, to date, few studies have examined whether these biases result in different predictive spatial models, potentially influencing conservation decisions. In this study, we compare distribution model predictions of feral pig (Sus scrofa) relative abundance using the two most common monitoring methods: detections from camera traps and visual surveys of pig sign. These data were collected during the same period using standardised methods at survey sites generated using a random stratified sampling design. We found that although site-level observed sign data were only loosely correlated with observed camera detections (R2 = 0.32-0.45), predicted sign and camera counts from zero-inflated models were well correlated (R2 = 0.78-0.88). In this study we show one example in which fitting two different forms of abundance data using environmental covariates explains most of the variance between datasets. We conclude that, as long as outputs are produced through appropriate modelling techniques, these two common methods of obtaining abundance data may be used interchangeably to produce comparable distribution maps for decision-making purposes. However, for monitoring purposes, sign and camera trap data may not be used interchangeably at the site level. © 2021 Journal Compilation","abundance index; feral pig; invasive species; monitoring; Pacific region; species distribution; Sus scrofa; ungulates; wild pig; wildlife management","comparative study; decision making; feral organism; geographical distribution; pig; relative abundance; species conservation; Sus scrofa; Ungulata","Ballari, S.

Shrub canopies can provide refuge to some animal species from predators and shelter from stressful environmental conditions by ameliorating high temperatures through lowering the amplitude of variation. Consequently, there have been many contrasts of shrub versus open effects; however, we extend this approach further by testing these effects on a gradient of shrub densities in the Carrizo National Monument, California. We tested the hypothesis that shrub density is a landscape-level predictor of vertebrate community composition and structure. We used camera traps, transects and focal observations to estimate animal density and composition, alongside the deployment of temperature sensors. Plots were established within shrub patches ranging from 0 to 12 shrubs per 10 m radius. Plots with relatively higher shrub densities had increased abundance and richness of vertebrate animal species. Temperature and residual dry matter were also important mediators of animal density and richness. Shrub cover was also an important driver of animal communities but we propose that shrub density is a more rapid proxy for vegetation effects in deserts relevant to wildlife conservationists, and managers. © 2021 Nordic Council for Wildlife Research.

I explored whether human disturbances increase vigilance in sika deer by comparing their behaviors in two areas with different levels of human activity using camera-trapping techniques. The deer spent a significantly higher proportion of time exhibiting vigilance behavior in the site with higher levels of human activity, supporting my initial hypothesis. In addition, their vigilance increased in winter, possibly due to hunting by humans. © RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF THERIOLOGY, 2021","hunting; landscape of fear; non-lethal effect; predation risk; ungulates","","Altendorf, K.B., Laundre, J.W., Lopez Gonzalez, C.A., Brown, J.S., Assessing effects of predation risk on foraging behavior of mule deer (2001) Journal of Mammalogy, 82 (2), pp. 430-439; Barton, K., (2015) MuMIn: multi-model Inference, , https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MuMIn/index.html, R package version 1.15.1; Benhaiem, S., Delon, M., Lourtet, B., Cargnelutti, B., Aulagnier, S., Hewison, A.J.M., Morellet, N., Verheyden, H., Hunting increases vigilance levels in roe deer and modifies feeding site selection (2008) Animal Behaviour, 76 (3), pp. 611-618; Benoist, S., Garel, M., Cugnasse, J.-M., Blanchard, P., Human disturbances, habitat characteristics and social environment generate sex-specific responses in vigilance of Mediterranean mouflon (2013) PLoS ONE, 8 (12), p. e82960; Bongi, P., Ciuti, S., Grignolio, S., Del Frate, M., Gandelli, D., Apollonio, M., Anti-predator behaviour, space use and habitat selection in female roe deer during the fawning season in a wolf area (2008) Journal of Zoology, 276 (3), pp. 242-251; Bonnot, N., Verheyden, H., Blanchard, P., Cote, J., Debeffe, L., Cargnelutti, B., Klein, F., Morellet, N., Interindividual variability in habitat use: evidence for a risk management syndrome in roe deer?

For this reason, remotely placed video cameras are increasingly used to monitor animals. One drawback of field-based video recordings is extensive review time. Computer vision can mitigate this cost and enhance data collection by extracting biological information from images with minimal time investment. MotionMeerkat is a new standalone program that identifies motion events from a video stream. After running a video, the user reviews a folder of candidate motion frames for the target organism. This tool reduces the time needed to review videos and accommodates a variety of inputs. I tested MotionMeerkat using hummingbird-plant videos recorded in a tropical montane forest. To validate the optimal parameter set for finding motion events, I counted hummingbirds observed from direct video review compared to events found in images returned from MotionMeerkat. To show the generality of the approach, MotionMeerkat was tested on a set of terrestrial and underwater videos. To assess the performance of the background subtraction for further image analysis, I hand counted the number of frames with target organisms and compared them to the MotionMeerkat output. MotionMeerkat was highly successful in finding motion events and often reduced the number of frames needed to capture hummingbird visitation by over 90%. Both background approaches effectively found a variety of organisms in ecological videos. I provide general recommendations for parameter settings and extending this approach in the future. © 2015 British Ecological Society.","Camera traps; Computer vision; Hummingbirds; Plant-animal interactions","Animalia; Trochilidae","Bolger, D.T., Morrison, T., Vance, B., Lee, D., Farid, H., A computer-assisted system for photographic mark-recapture analysis (2012) Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 3, pp. 813-822; Boom, B., He, J., Palazzo, S., Huang, P., A research tool for long-term and continuous analysis of fish assemblage in coral-reefs using underwater camera footage (2014) Ecological Informatics, 23, pp. 83-97; Bouwmans, T., Gonzàlez, J., Shan, C., Piccardi, M., Davis, L., Special issue on background modeling for foreground detection in real-world dynamic scenes (2013) Machine Vision and Applications, 25, pp. 1101-1103; Bradski, G., The OpenCV Library (2000) Doctor Dobbs Journal, 25, pp. 120-126; Crall, J., Stewart, C., (2013), HotSpotter-Patterned species instance recognition. 2013 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV); Dell, A.I., Bender, J.A., Branson, K., Couzin, I.D., de Polavieja, G.G., Noldus, L.P.J.J., Automated image-based tracking and its application in ecology (2014) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 29, pp. 417-428; Kalal, Z., Mikolajczyk, K., Matas, J., Tracking-Learning-Detection (2011) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 6, pp. 1-14; Kühl, H.S., Burghardt, T., Animal biometrics: quantifying and detecting phenotypic appearance (2013) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 28, pp. 432-441; Maglianesi, M., Blüthgen, N., Böhning-Gaese, K., Schleuning, M., Morphological traits determine specialization and resource use in plant-hummingbird networks in the Neotropics (2014) Ecology, 95, pp. 3325-3334; Mallet, D., Pelletier, D., Underwater video techniques for observing coastal marine biodiversity: a review of sixty years of publications (1952-2012) (2014) Fisheries Research, 154, pp. 44-62; O'Driscoll, R., de Joux, P., Species identification in seamount fish aggregations using moored underwater video (2012) ICES Journal of Marine Science, 69, pp. 648-659; Pennekamp, F., Schtickzelle, N., Implementing image analysis in laboratory-based experimental systems for ecology and evolution: a hands-on guide (2013) Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 4, pp. 483-492; Qing, C., Dickinson, P., (2011), pp. 3577-3580. , Automatic nesting seabird detection based on boosted HOG-LBP descriptors.

The conservation status needs to be updated since no recent studies have been conducted in the Atlantic Forest. Therefore, we aimed to estimate the density, occupancy and detectability of D. leporina in one of the larger Atlantic Forest remnants in Espírito Santo, Brazil, the Vale Natural Reserve (VNR). We surveyed four line transects between April 2013 and May 2014 to estimate density and abundance. To model occupancy probability, as well as to document activity pattern, we selected 39 sampling sites with one camera-trap each. Estimated density was 21 ± 3 individuals km–2 and estimated population size was 4935 ± 368 individuals. Occupancy increases with palm density, distance from forest edge, and canopy cover.

By adding free-living exotic mammals, removing forest-dependent native ones, isolating forest patches from large protected areas and reducing landscape forest cover, human activities may drive mammal communities towards regional biotic homogenization. Objectives: We assessed how landscape forest cover and proximity to the largest and best-preserved area of the Catimbau National Park—one of the largest protected areas of the Brazilian Caatinga—affect α- and β-diversity of medium- and large-sized mammals, considering native and exotic species. Methods: Using camera traps (total effort of 2340 cameras/day), we obtained 823 records of 15 species (8 natives and 7 exotics) in 18 landscapes of 1-km radius. We estimated diversity metrics within and among landscapes and used generalized linear models to assess the effect of forest loss and isolation on diversity metrics. Results: As expected, forest loss decreased α-diversity of native species and increased the diversity and relative abundance of exotics. However, proximity to the preserved area showed weak effect on α-diversity, suggesting that this area does not work regionally as source for natives neither as ecological trap for exotics. Supporting the biotic homogenization hypothesis, β-diversity of natives decreased and β-diversity of exotics increased in more deforested landscapes. Yet, species composition was weakly related to forest cover and isolation. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that deforestation jeopardizes native species, favors exotics, and drives mammal communities towards biotic homogenization. Protected areas should be properly implemented to safeguard mammal diversity. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Biotic homogenization; Caatinga; Habitat amount; Isolation; Land-use change; Tropical dry forest","anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; caatinga; conservation planning; deforestation; human activity; landscape change; mammal; native species; protected area; relative abundance; Brazil; Catimbau National Park; Pernambuco; Mammalia","Albuquerque, U.P., de Lima, A.E., El-Deir, A.C.A., de Albuquerque, U.P., de Lima, A.E., El-Deir, A.C., de Lima, A.L., de Moura, G.J., Caatinga revisited: ecology and conservation of an important seasonal dry forest (2012) Sci World J, 2012, pp. 1-18; Alves, R., Feijó, A., Barboza, R., Souto, W.M., Fernandes-Ferreira, H., Cordeiro-Estrela, P., Langguth, A., Game mammals of the Caatinga biome (2016) Ethnobiol Conserv, 5, pp. 1-51; Andrade, J.F., Alvarado, F., Santos, J.C., Santos, B.A., Rainfall reduction increases insect herbivory in tropical herb communities (2020) J Veg Sci, 31, pp. 487-496; Arnan, X., Leal, I.R., Tabarelli, M., Andrade, J.F., Barros, M.F., Câmara, T., Jamelli, D., Oliveira, F.M., A framework for deriving measures of chronic anthropogenic disturbance: surrogate, direct, single and multi-metric indices in Brazilian Caatinga (2018) Ecol Indic, 94, pp. 274-282; Arroyo-Rodríguez, V., Fahrig, L., Tabarelli, M., Watling, J.I., Tischendorf, L., Benchimol, M., Cazetta, E., Tscharntke, T., Designing optimal human-modified landscapes for forest biodiversity conservation (2020) Ecol Lett; Baselga, A., Orme, C.D.L., Betapart: an R package for the study of beta diversity (2012) Methods Ecol Evol, 3, pp. 808-812; Battisti, C., Fanelli, G., Amori, G., Luiselli, L., Capizzi, D., Do disturbance-sensitive and habitat-specialized species have a smaller range size?

Basic ecological information such as habitat selection and diet is also lacking, especially in Central America. Using surveys for tracks and latrines from ten rivers on the Osa Peninsula of Costa Rica, we report results on habitat selection at the local and micro-habitat scales, describe the general diet from 127 scats, and broadly discuss detection and general survey methods. We found that otters were positively associated with small-scale pastures surrounded by nearby forests at a local scale and/or negatively associated with densely forested areas. Otters further preferred deeper rivers at both local and microhabitat scales, while the availability of latrine substrates and sandbars was both important predictors of detection probability. We also deployed 12 camera traps to detect otters, and found they were much less efficient than sign surveys at determining occupancy, though our sample size is small. We conclude by proposing a methodology for standardized monitoring protocol using occupancy surveys which could be implemented across the Neotropical otter’s range. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

The dynamics of freezing and thawing, and possible shifts of freezing patterns over time, can help in understanding the local and global climate systems. One way to acquire the spatiooral information about lake ice formation, independent of clouds, is to analyse webcam images. This paper intends to move towards a universal model for monitoring lake ice with freely available webcam data. We demonstrate good performance, including the ability to generalise across different winters and lakes, with a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for semantic image segmentation, <i>Deeplab</i> v3+. Moreover, we design a variant of that model, termed <i>Deep-U-Lab</i>, which predicts sharper, more correct segmentation boundaries. We have tested the model's ability to generalise with data from multiple camera views and two different winters. On average, it achieves Intersection-over-Union (IoU) values of &asymp;71% across different cameras and &asymp;69% across different winters, greatly outperforming prior work. Going even further, we show that the model even achieves 60% IoU on arbitrary images scraped from photo-sharing websites. As part of the work, we introduce a new benchmark dataset of webcam images, <i>Photi-LakeIce</i>, from multiple cameras and two different winters, along with pixel-wise ground truth annotations. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

Scent marking is common among solitary, low-density, and wide-ranging carnivores, such as felids. Understanding the functional role of scent marking will inform our understanding of the behavioral ecology of carnivores. We investigated patterns of scent marking by pumas (Puma concolor) and jaguars (Panthera onca) via weekly surveys of trails for scrapes and documenting scent-marking behaviors and responses using motion-triggered video cameras. Jaguars mainly sprayed vegetation, whereas pumas mainly scraped the ground. Only a subset of individuals for both pumas and jaguars were responsible for the majority of scent-marking activity. On average, male pumas scraped more frequently (scrapes/km) than male jaguars, and the scrape rate of male pumas increased following the presence of potential mates and competitors. Male pumas returned to trails more quickly following the presence of conspecifics (potential competitors or mates) than in their absence, however, visitation by male jaguars increased in response to competitors only. A male puma detected travelling with three different females on separate occasions scraped more frequently than males who were not detected with females. This study suggests that jaguars and pumas are constantly assessing, and reacting to, the presence and marks of competitors and potential mates, facilitating the maintenance of complex social structures. © 2019 American Society of Mammalogists.","Communication; Interspecific; Jaguar; Puma; Scent marking; Scraping","behavioral ecology; communication behavior; conspecific; felid; fitness; functional role; interspecific interaction; Neotropical Region; scent marking; social organization; sympatry; Animalia; Felidae; Panthera onca; Puma concolor","Allen, M.L., (2014) The Ecology and Behaviour of Pumas (Puma Concolor) in Northern California, USA, , Ph.

Methods: In this study, we used infrared-triggered camera trapping, field surveys, and interviews to create a dataset on the distribution of species (mammals and birds) in Hebei Wulingshan Nature Reserve (Hebei Province, China). Results: We identified 101 species (14 orders, 38 families), 64 of which (2,142 effective records) were selected for environmental niche modeling. All results were reclassified into three groups: “priority areas” (areas including the potential distributions of over 80% of species), “important areas” (those with 50% of species), and “normal areas” (all other areas). Our results show that priority areas (1.31–1.82 km2) and important areas (7.73–21.44 km2) for conservation were mainly covered by the core and experimental zones of the reserve; additionally, a kilometer-wide margin around the outside of the nature reserve seems to be important to maintaining biodiversity. Discussion: We close by suggesting some actions for enhancing conservation of biodiversity in the reserve, including monitoring, strengthen law enforcements, introducing popular science, and co-operating with local people.

Conventional techniques, such as aerial-roving creel surveys, can lead to estimation bias as they are limited to sampling fragments of these fisheries, which are often fluid and temporally dynamic. In British Columbia, Canada, the existing aerial-roving framework for monitoring marine recreational salmon fisheries relies on angler testimony to report diel temporal distribution of angling and flights to scale-up effort estimation. This work involved implementing two shore-based autonomous cameras set at high capture-rates. One system allowed for the estimation of harbour-specific effort and retention, while the second system informed the timing of angler use by monitoring a popular nearby fishing location. We employed a two-step image filtering system which included the use of a novel deep learning-based system involving a Gaussian Mixture Model-based motion detector for the automatic detection of vessels, to efficiently analyze over one million images. We calculated effort and retention estimates using catch-per-unit effort data from interviews and detailed the diel activity of observed fishing using empirical cumulative distribution and activity pattern analyses. We found that creel estimates were predicting the timing of fishing relatively well, but alone, they may be failing to account for substantial effort in the afternoons. We also provided new insight into a notable amount of off-season fishing effort, which is currently lacking in creel estimates, by surveying beyond peak-season. Our findings suggest that cameras can provide a viable tool in British Columbia for extending the temporal resolution of existing methods while providing an efficient and cost-effective alternative to flights to expand effort data. Increasing camera monitoring to cover additional marinas and popular fishing locales could improve estimation and protect vital fish species. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Angling; Camera monitoring; Deep-learning tools; Fisheries management; Image processing; Pacific salmon; Recreational fishing","","Afrifa-Yamoah, E., Taylor, S.M., Mueller, U., Trade-off assessments between reading cost and accuracy measures for digital camera monitoring of recreational boating effort (2021) Fish.

In this study we investigate the social structure of a desert dwelling population of striped hyena Hyaena hyaena. This species is historically regarded as strictly solitary albeit being the least studied of the extant Hyaenids. Accumulating evidence regarding the frequency of social interactions suggests a revision of striped hyena social structure is required. We hypothesized that striped hyena has a social structure that is more complex than expected for a strictly solitary species. For that end, we deployed an array of camera-traps in a remote desert region in Israel, and compared observed frequencies of striped hyena co-occurrence against null models to test whether hyena co-occurred more than expected by chance. Seven adults were (re)captured by our camera-traps in 49 different instances over 83 tracking days. Of these, 6 exhibited shared space-use around a scarce, isolated perennial water source. Five of them, co-occurred with other hyena (in 3 instances) significantly more frequent than expected by chance (and that timing suggests reproduction is unlikely to be the driving factor). Our findings substantiate evidence of complex social structure in striped hyena, highlight the importance of a scarce resource in space-use and sociality, and provide a baseline for future research of striped hyena social structure. We suggest that similar methods be employed to evaluate social structure in other “solitary species” to better understand their social dynamics. © The Author(s) (2020).","Behavioral ecology; Cluster in space; Hyaena hyaena; Social interaction; Social structure; Striped hyena","","Abi Said, M, Dloniak, SMD, Hyaena hyaena (2015) The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 2015, , http://dx.doi.org/10.2305/IUCN.UK.2015-2.RLTS.T10274A45195080.en, T10274A45195080; Akçakaya, HR, Butchart, SHM, Mace, GM, Stuart, SN, Hilton-Taylor, C, Use and misuse of the IUCN Red List Criteria in projecting climate change impacts on biodiversity (2006) Glob Change Biol, 12, pp. 2037-2043; Allee, WC, Park, O, Emerson Ae Park, T, Schmidt, KP, (1949) Principles of Animal Ecology, , Philadelphia and London: W.B.

Between October 2017 and October 2018, we placed 167 infrared-triggered cameras to investigate the biodiversity of wild mammals and birds in Daxiangling Nature Reserve, Sichuan Province. A total of 3,317 independent wildlife photographs were collected with an extensive survey effort of 6,738 camera-days. These included 2,673 photographs of 23 mammal species belonging to 5 orders and 14 families, and 644 photographs of 33 bird species from 5 orders and 11 families. Among these, 3 species including Ailuropoda melanoleuca, Budorcas tibetanus, Moschus berezovskii are listed as national first-class protected wild animals, and 10 species including Macaca thibetana, Ursus thibetanus, Ailurus fulgens, Martes flavigula, Capricornis milneedwardsi, Cervus equinus, Ithaginis cruentus, Chrysolophus amherstiae, Lophura nycthemera, Tragopan temminckii are listed as national second-class protected wild animals in China. Of the species identified, Moschus berezovskii is Critically Endangered (CR), 9 species are Vulnerable (VU), and 10 species are Near Threatened (NT) in the Red List of China’s Vertebrates. Among the recorded species, 2 species are listed as Endangered (EN), 5 species are listed as Vulnerable (VU), 3 species are listed as Threatened (NT) by the IUCN Red List. Four species are also listed in Appendix I and six other species are in Appendix II of the CITES regulations. Petaurista xanthotis, Cervus equinus, Dendrocopos darjellensis, Nucifraga caryocatactes, Turdus obscurus, Brachypteryx montana and Trochalopteron formosum are new record species in Daxiangling Nature Reserve. We found that Elaphodus cephalophus (RAI = 125.26) had the highest relative abundance, followed by Macaca thibetana (RAI = 64.71) and Tragopan temminckii (RAI = 43.34). This study provides basic information on the species composition and relative abundance of large and mid-sized mammals and terrestrial birds in Daxiangling Nature Reserve; it will also provide information and references to wildlife management and protection. © 2020, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Native warm-season grass polycultures and switchgrass monocultures offer alternative land covers for airports that could benefit current risk-mitigation efforts in addition to offering economic and environmental benefits. We compared use of a native warm-season grass polyculture and switchgrass Panicum virgatum monoculture by white-tailed deer (deer; Odocoileus virginianus) and coyote Canis latrans, using remote cameras in Mississippi, during 2011–2012. Coyotes and deer were observed 27% and 51% less in switchgrass monoculture than in native warm-season grass polyculture, respectively. However, November detections and cumulative hazard score demonstrated the greatest differences between treatments, especially for deer. Considering deer and coyotes are among the most hazardous mammal species to aircraft, switchgrass monocultures could be a better alternative land cover than native warm-season grass polycultures for some airport turf areas. Increased land coverage of switchgrass monocultures could benefit airport wildlife-hazard mitigation but needs validation by comparing alternative land covers to more traditional airport land covers. © 2018, Springer Verlag.","Airport management; Canis latrans; Habitat modification; Odocoileus virginianus; Wildlife strikes","","Andelt, W.F., Andelt, S.H., Habitat use by coyotes in southeastern Nebraska (1981) Journal of Wildlife Manage-Ment, 145, pp. 1001-1005; Allan, J., Managing Wildlife Hazards to Aircraft (2013) International Airport Review, 17, pp. 31-34; Barone, J.A., Historical presence and distribution of prairies in the Black Belt of Mississippi and Alabama (2005) Castanea, 70, pp. 170-183; Biondi, K.M., Belant, J.L., Martin, J.A., Devault, T.L., Wang, G., White-tailed deer incidents with U.S. civil aircraft (2011) Wildlife Society Bulletin, 35, pp. 303-309; Biondi, K.M., Belant, J.L., Martin, J.A., Devault, T.L., Wang, G., Integrating mammalian hazards with management at U.S. civil airports: A case study (2014) Human– Wildlife Interactions, 8, pp. 31-38; Blackwell, B.F., Devault, T.L., Fernández-Juricic, E., Dolbeer, R.A., Wildlife collisions with aircraft: A missing component of land-use planning for airports (2009) Landscape and Urban Planning, 86, pp. 162-170; Blackwell, B.F., Seamans, T.W., Schmidt, P.M., de Vault, T.L., Belant, J.L., Whittingham, M.J., Martin, J.A., Fernández-Juricic, E., A framework for managing airport grasslands and birds amidst conflicting priorities (2013) Ibis, 155, pp. 189-193; Chamberlain, M.J., Leopold, B.D., Dietary patterns of sympatric bobcats and coyotes in central Mississippi (1999) Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the Southeastern Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, 53, pp. 204-219; (2008) CAP 772: Birdstrike Risk Management for Aerodromes.

Our study site was in an oil concession within a littoral mosaic landscape. We conducted surveys along 199 line transects and installed camera traps on 99 of these transects to document mammal presence and abundance. We used generalized linear mixed-effect models to document associations between variables related to the ecosystem (land cover, topography, and hydrology), roads (coating, width of rights of way, condition, type of vehicle used on the road, traffic level, affiliation of users, and general type of road), and other human disturbances (urbanization, agriculture, hunting, logging, gathering, and industrial activities) and the abundance or presence of 17 species or groups of mammals including elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis), buffalo (Syncerus caffer), sitatunga (Tragelaphus spekei), red river hog (Potamochoerus porcus), smaller ungulates, gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), side-striped jackal (Canis adustus), carnivores, monkeys, and large rodents. Some types of roads and other human disturbances were negatively associated with the abundance or presence of elephants, buffalos, gorillas, sitatungas, some monkeys, and duikers. The pattern of associations of mammals with roads and other human disturbances was diverse and included positive associations with road presence (red river hog, some monkeys, and duikers), agriculture (sitatunga, small carnivores, and large rodents) and industrial activities (sitatunga, red river hog, red duikers, and side-striped jackal). Our results suggest that the community of mammals we studied was mostly affected by hunting, agriculture, and urbanization, which are facilitated by road presence. We recommend increased regulation of agriculture, hunting, and road building in the area. © 2013 Society for Conservation Biology.","Abundance index; Camera trapping; Generalized models; Hunting; Mosaic landscape; Oil extraction","abundance; anthropogenic effect; cohort analysis; habitat fragmentation; line transect; mammal; roadkill; spatial distribution; animal; animal dispersal; article; biodiversity; biological model; ecosystem; environmental protection; Gabon; human; human activities; mammal; physiology; population density; traffic and transport; Animal Distribution; Animals; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Gabon; Human Activities; Humans; Mammals; Models, Biological; Population Density; Transportation; Gabon; Bubalus; Canis adustus; Canis familiaris; Elephantidae; Gorilla gorilla; Haplorhini; Loxodonta cyclotis; Mammalia; Pan; Pan troglodytes; Potamochoerus porcus; Rodentia; Suidae; Syncerus caffer; Tragelaphus spekii; Ungulata","Akaike, E., Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle (1973) Second International Symposium on Information Theory, pp. 267-281. , B.

This paper describes the use, and provide the initial results of a continuous time-lapse image monitoring system, cabled with underwater cameras located in a Natura 2000 site: Šibenik (Croatia, 43°44′9.85″N and 15°52′37.62″E, in the Adriatic Sea). The images of the mobile megafauna recorded during daylight hours from January 10 to the end of April 2018 were analysed. Overall, 13,808 images were analysed and a total of 136,195 animals were identified. A total of 16,216 fish specimens, belonging to 35 species, were identified from 10,026 images. These included 24 species of commercial interest, including the billfish Thunnus thynnus (Atlantic bluefin tuna) and animals of conservation interest such as the loggerhead turtle, Caretta caretta. The data collected in the time series showed an increase of fish biodiversity from winter to spring. Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) revealed significant daily and seasonal changes in the assemblage structure. Canonical Analysis of Principal Coordinates and Principal Component Analysis indicated that fish assemblages were characterized by significant temporal changes at the mean Trophic Level and in the presence of different Functional Groups. Advantages and constraints of an image-based monitoring approach by cabled camera are discussed in relation the potential applications within the frame of international management programs, including the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cabled cameras; Daily and seasonal variations; Fish biodiversity; Marine protected areas; Video-monitoring","biodiversity; diurnal variation; environmental monitoring; protected area; seasonal variation; underwater camera; videography; Croatia; Sibenik; Animalia; Caretta caretta; Testudines; Thunnus thynnus; Xiphiidae","Hewitt, J.E., Ellis, J.I., Thrush, S.F., Multiple stressors, nonlinear effects and the implications of climate change impacts on marine coastal ecosystems (2016) Global Change Biol., 22, pp. 2665-2675; Canonico, G., Buttigieg, P.L., Montes, E., Muller-Karger, F.E., Stepien, C., Wright, D., Benson, A., Murton, B., Global observational needs and resources for marine biodiversity (2019) Front.

Deterrence methods can be used to reduce impacts of human structures or activities on wildlife, or to resolve conservation conflicts in areas where animals may be regarded as a nuisance or pose a health hazard. Here we test two methods (acoustic and radar) that have shown potential for deterring bats away from areas where they forage and/ or roost. Using both infrared video and acoustic methods for counting bat passes, we show that ultrasonic speakers were effective as bat deterrents at foraging sites, but radar was not. Ultrasonic deterrents decreased overall bat activity (filmed on infrared cameras) by ~80% when deployed alone and in combination with radar. However, radar alone had no effect on bat activity when video or acoustic data were analysed using generalised linear mixed effect models. Feeding buzzes of all species were reduced by 79% and 69% in the ultrasound only treatment when compared to the control and radar treatments, but only the ultrasound treatment was significant in post-hoc tests. Species responded differently to the ultrasound treatments and we recorded a deterrent effect on both Pipistrellus pipistrellus (~40–80% reduction in activity) and P. pygmaeus (~30–60% reduction), but not on Myotis species. However, only the ultrasound and radar treatment was significant (when compared to control and radar) in post-hoc tests for P. pipistrellus. Deterrent treatment was marginally non-significant for P. pygmaeus, but the ultrasound only treatment was significant when compared to radar in post-hoc tests. We therefore suggest that acoustic, but not radar methods are explored further as deterrents for bats. The use of acoustic deterrence should always be assessed on a case-by-case basis, with a focus on bat conservation. © 2020 Gilmour et al.

Using the deep learning model to automatically identify the empty camera trap images can reduce the workload of manual classification significantly. However, the performance of deep learning models is easily affected by the class imbalance problem of training datasets, which is a common problem for actual wildlife survey projects. Almost all previous studies on empty image recognition used down-sampling or oversampling methods to eliminate the effect of class imbalance on the performance of deep learning classifiers. The class imbalance problem has been systematically studied in the field of traditional image recognition, yet very limited research is available in the context of identifying camera trap images taken from highly cluttered natural scenes. This study systematically studied the impact of class imbalance on model performance when using a deep learning model to identify empty camera trap images. Then we proposed the construction method of training sets of the deep learning model when the data set has different class imbalance levels. Based on results from our experiments we concluded that (i) the class imbalance showed little effect on the performance of the model when the empty image ratio (EIR) in the data set was between 10% and 70%, so the training sets can be randomly built without changing the class distribution; (ii) we recommended using oversampling to partially eliminate class imbalance to reduce omission errors when the EIR of the data set exceeded 70%; (iii) when the EIRs of the training set and the test set were close, the overall error, omission error, and commission error of the model were relatively smaller, and the model tended to achieve a better overall performance; (iv) the omission and commission errors can be adjusted by changing the percentage of empty images in the training set. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Camera trap images; Class imbalance; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Image classification","algorithm; artificial neural network; construction method; detection method; image analysis; image classification","Bennin, K.E., Keung, J., Phannachitta, P., Monden, A., Mensah, S., [journal first] MAHAKIL: Diversity based oversampling approach to alleviate the class imbalance issue in software defect prediction (2018) 2018 IEEE/ACM 40th international conference on software engineering (ICSE), p. 699. , Presented at the 2018 IEEE/ACM 40th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE); Buda, M., Maki, A., Mazurowski, M.A., A systematic study of the class imbalance problem in convolutional neural networks (2018) Neural Netw., 106, pp. 249-259; Chang, J., Chen, Y., Batch-normalized Maxout Network in Network (2015) arXiv. arXiv:1511.02583; Chawla, N.V., Data mining for imbalanced datasets: an overview (2010) Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Handbook, pp. 875-886. , O.

Increases in predator populations and nest predation may play an important role in this decline, along with habitat loss. However, the role of various predators has often remained unclear. We conducted a study with artificial nests and wildlife cameras (n = 104) in agricultural landscapes during 2015–2016 in South Finland. Our trials formed a 400-m wide gradient from forest to field. The aim of our study was to monitor nest survival and nest predators in a spatial and temporal scale. We tested the effect of distance to the forest and nest visibility to nest predation. During an 8-day period, 39.4% of the artificial nests were predated. Fifty percent of the predators were birds, 40% mammals, and 10% remained unknown. The three dominant predators of our artificial nests were the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) with 11 nests and the hooded crow (Corvus corone cornix) and the magpie (Pica pica) with 10 depredated nests each. Our analysis indicates that avian predators preyed upon nests in open fields further away from the forest edge, whereas mammalian predation concentrated closer to the forest edge. Predation occurred more likely at the beginning of the survey and nest survival increased as days passed. Our study highlights the efficiency of using wildlife camera traps in nest predation studies. We also suggest that the ongoing expansion of alien predators across Europe may have a greater impact on ground-nesting bird populations than previously anticipated. © 2018, The Author(s).","Edge effect;

The accurate measurement of shallow flow velocities can greatly contribute to understanding and simulating the sediment transport and soil erosion. In this study, a novel observation system of thermal infrared imaging and computer vision was established to measure the velocities of shallow flow. The observation system consisted of three subsystems, such as the thermal tracer control, image acquisition, and transmission, as well as image calculation. Specifically, the control subsystem of the thermal tracer was mainly responsible for the constant temperature of hot water, including the electric heater, temperature sensor, and hot water pump. The subsystem of image acquisition and transmission consisted of a FLIR ONE 3.1.0 thermal infrared camera, 4 thermal infrared targets, and a wireless router, particularly for the thermal infrared images of thermal tracer migration. The subsystem of image calculation was used to extract the high frame rate from the thermal infrared images, including the data storage and computing matching. As such, the velocity of shallow flow was dynamically monitored using the automatic control of thermal tracer, instantaneous image acquisition, image correction, noise removal, and centroid determination. Furthermore, a series of experiments were conducted to verify the system in the Simulated Runoff Hall of the State Key Laboratory of Soil Erosion and Dryland Farming on the Loess Plateau. The experimental glass tank was in the size of 4.6 × 0.196 × 0.1 m3 at a gradient of 15° to the horizontal, together with the different flows (0.2-1.5 L/s). The results showed that the observation system presented a higher accuracy than before, suitable for the dynamic transport of thermal tracer in the different temporal and spatial scales. Specifically, an excellent performance was achieved, where the measurement standard deviation of the system was 0.0201 m/s, the observation accuracy reached 98.33%, the observation time resolution was 1/9 s, and the spatial resolution was up to 2 mm. Moreover, the accuracy of the observation system with the thermal infrared imaging was much higher than that with the traditional tracer techniques (dye and salt tracer). The maximum and minimum relative errors of the observation system were -9.61% and 0.16%, respectively, and the range of the relative errors was within ±10%. The maximum relative error of the dye tracer was 75.92%, and the minimum relative error was 12.03%. The maximum and minimum relative errors of salt tracer were -26.67% and 0.11%, respectively, where 52% of the samples presented the relative errors within ±10%. Correspondingly, the observation system with thermal infrared imaging was provided a reliable way to measure the shallow flow velocity. By contrast, either the dye tracer or salt tracer cannot calculate the overall situation of water flow, due to the manually recording one-time value during measurement. Fortunately, the observation system with thermal infrared imaging can be widely expected to accurately record the overall situation of the water flow. More importantly, the leading edge points and centroid points of the thermal tracer area can be identified at different time intervals, thereby accurately calculating the leading edge velocity and centroid velocity of the water flow. The images can also be used to trace the development of water flow in various tracer sections at different times. As such, it can be possible to measure the tracer migration velocity along the direction of water flow and the diffusion velocity perpendicular to the direction of water flow in the future. This technique can also be applied to monitor the rainfall erosion and runoff scour in the process of soil erosion. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

By exploiting the strength and simplicity of repeated digital photography and color indices, a majority of the phenological studies have been successful at investigating leaf phenology, while flowering phenology is rarely studied using the automatic capture and analysis of repeated photography. In this study, we trained and tested 5 different pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms to detect flowering events from images of white colored flowering trees and analyzed the possible factors that can affect the performance of the models. We collected images from the web and processed the images into a binary classification dataset in which a positive label indicated a tree in bloom. We also installed time-lapse cameras and captured images to validate the performances of the models in the real-world. Regarding the CNN architectures, the VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet101, MobileNet, and NASNet models were adopted, and the model weights were pretrained using the ImageNet-1000 dataset. After 20 epochs of training with 16,005 images, all of the models were successfully trained, reaching over 98% test accuracy, and 4 models reached over 99% test accuracy. All the models also showed accurate and stable performances in detecting flowering in time-series datasets with a minor inconstancy at the beginning of the flowering stages. Overall, the NASNet model showed the best performance in both the test dataset and the time-series datasets. A detailed analysis of the performance revealed that the models were especially prone to misclassify images with small relative flowering areas and were affected by the number of samples in the training dataset. We concluded that the preprocessing of the images and the size of the training dataset are essential for the high performance of the models compared to the architecture of the individual models. Furthermore, in addition to the need for a larger dataset, the proper resolution is required to successfully detect flowering from repeated photography, and most current phenological networks do not meet this condition. We suggest that mid-range photography combined with CNN algorithms can be a legitimate approach to properly accumulate and automatically process the data for studying flowering phenology. © 2020","","Binary trees; Biology; Classification (of information); Climate change; Color photography; Convolutional neural networks; E-learning; Forestry; Machine learning; Network architecture; Statistical tests; Time series; Binary classification; Digital photography; Flowering phenology; Individual models; Number of samples; Repeat photographies; Stable performance; Training dataset; Image analysis","Abramovich, F., Pensky, M., Classification with many classes: challenges and pluses (2019) J.

Density is among the most useful metrics of population status because it is directly comparable across space and time. Unfortunately, density is difficult to measure reliably, especially for mobile, cryptic species. Recently, efforts have turned to approximating density based on its relationship to more readily estimable indices of occurrence. However, the relationship between density and such indices is contingent on several key assumptions that field studies often violate. Recent research has shown that these relationships are unreliable where sampling units are not independent, as is often the case when estimating density or occurrence of large carnivores. Here, we use the largest data set thus far collected for leopards (Panthera pardus)—88 camera-trap surveys undertaken in 24 protected areas between 2013 and 2018—to explore how density and other population characteristics relate to parameter estimates in occupancy and Royle–Nichols abundance models. We show how home-range size confounds underlying relationships, with larger home ranges inflating the proportion of area used (PAU) and resulting in double counting in abundance models. Relativizing estimates of occupancy and abundance by home-range size improved their relationship with density, but the relationship remained weak and largely uninformative for management. Our findings illustrate the pitfalls of using the PAU or abundance as implicit proxies for density and highlight the challenges of assessing population status for wide-ranging, cryptic species across fragmented landscapes. © 2019 The Authors.","carnivores;

However, high-speed trains produce unknown avian mortality due to birds using the railway and being unable to avoid approaching trains. Safety and logistic difficulties have precluded until now mortality estimation in railways through carcass removal, but information technologies can overcome such problems. We present the results obtained with an experimental on-board system to record bird-train collisions composed by a frontal recording camera, a GPS navigation system and a data storage unit. An observer standing in the cabin behind the driver controlled the system and filled out a form with data of collisions and bird observations in front of the train. Photographs of the train front taken before and after each journey were used to improve the record of killed birds. Trains running the 321.7 km line between Madrid and Albacete (Spain) at speeds up to 250-300 km/h were equipped with the system during 66 journeys along a year, totaling approximately 14,700 km of effective recording. The review of videos produced 1,090 bird observations, 29.4% of them corresponding to birds crossing the infrastructure under the catenary and thus facing collision risk. Recordings also showed that 37.7% bird crossings were of animals resting on some element of the infrastructure moments before the train arrival, and that the flight initiation distance of birds (mean ± SD) was between 60 ± 33 m (passerines) and 136 ± 49 m (raptors). Mortality in the railway was estimated to be 60.5 birds/km year on a line section with 53 runs per day and 26.1 birds/km year in a section with 25 runs per day. Our results are the first published estimation of bird mortality in a HSR and show the potential of information technologies to yield useful data for monitoring the impact of trains on birds via on-board recording systems. Moreover, recordings point to the use of the infrastructure by birds as a key issue leading to bird train-kill. © 2017 García de la Morena, Malo, Hervás, Mata, González, Morales and Herranz.","Agrarian birds; Camera; Environmental impact assessment; Flight initiation distance; High-speed railway; Infrastructure; Monitoring; Road kill","","Albalate, D., Bel, G., Fageda, X., Competition and cooperation between high-speed rail and air transportation services in Europe (2015) J.

While many methods exist to estimate abundance from individually identifiable animals, it is much more difficult to estimate abundance of unmarked animals. One step toward noninvasive abundance estimation is the use of passive detectors such as remote cameras or acoustic recording devices. However, existing methods for estimating abundance from cameras for unmarked animals are limited by variable detection probability and have not taken full advantage of the information in camera trapping rate. We developed a time to event (TTE) model to estimate abundance from trapping rate. This estimate requires independent estimates of animal movement, so we collapsed the sampling occasions to create a space to event (STE) model that is not sensitive to movement rate. We further simplified the STE model into an instantaneous sampling (IS) estimator that applies fixed-area counts to cameras. The STE and IS models utilize time-lapse photographs to eliminate the variability in detection probability that comes with motion-sensor photographs. We evaluated the three methods with simulations and performed a case study to estimate elk (Cervus canadensis) abundance from remote camera trap data in Idaho. Simulations demonstrated that the TTE model is sensitive to movement rate, but the STE and IS methods are unbiased regardless of movement. In our case study, elk abundance estimates were comparable to those from a recent aerial survey in the area, demonstrating that these new methods allow biologists to estimate abundance from unmarked populations without tracking individuals over time. © 2018 The Authors.","abundance; Cervus canadensis; density; elk; exponential distribution; Poisson point process; remote camera; space to event; time to event; time-lapse photography; unmarked population","","Balestrieri, A., Ruiz-González, A., Vergara, M., Capelli, E., Tirozzi, P., Alfino, S., Minuti, G., Saino, N., Pine marten density in lowland riparian woods: a test of the Random Encounter Model based on genetic data (2016) Mammalian Biology, 81, pp. 439-446; Barker, R.J., Schofield, M.R., Link, W.A., Sauer, J.R., On the reliability of N-mixture models for count data (2017) Biometrics, 74, pp. 369-377; Berkson, J., Do radioactive decay events follow a random Poisson-exponential?

Traditionally, camera traps are set aimed horizontally towards a scent lure, capturing images of animals as they move past. A vertical camera orientation is also being used, whereby the camera lens and sensor face vertically down towards the scent lure, capturing images from above. We aimed to compare detection of southern brown bandicoots and long-nosed potoroos by camera traps set horizontally, to those set vertically. We also considered the number of false triggers and ease of species identification. Over 21 nights, we monitored 18 camera stations, each consisting of one PixController Inc. DigitalEye™ 7.2 camera aimed horizontally and one vertically, towards the same scent lure. We used PRESENCE (Version 3.0 (Beta)) to estimate detection probabilities for the two species, comparing a null model to a model with camera orientation as a covariate affecting probability of detection. Detection probabilities for both species was 25 times higher by vertical than by horizontal cameras, with no significant difference in false triggers. Vertical cameras also increased ease of species identification. Vertical camera orientation is shown to be superior in our study system, providing a valid alternative method.

Thermal images were collected over three months from four Asian elephants at the Tisch Family Zoological Gardens in Jerusalem in which 935 body regions were identified with possible inflammatory pathologies. Suspected thermal areas were divided into three groups according to the appearance of inflammatory processes in a clinical examination: negative, positive and a pre-inflammatory group, which showed a thermal change while imaging, with clinical signs appearing only later on. An analysis of the documented regions it was found that in areas with a clinical signs delta temperatures were significantly higher compared to areas with no clinical signs. It was also found that pre-clinical areas showed a significantly higher temperature compared with that of the clinical and non-clinical areas. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) test results showed an area under curve (AUC) of 0.91 with sensitivity values of 89.2% and a specificity of 83.4%. In addition, positive predictive value and negative predictive value received were: NPPV = 99.4%, PPV = 19.3%. It was concluded that thermography can be an effective diagnostic tool for early diagnosis of inflammatory processes and useful for regular and continuous monitoring of zoo elephants in general. Early detection of inflammatory processes using this technique makes it possible to prevent unnecessary stress that often accompanies veterinary examinations and to accelerate recovery. © 2017, Israel Veterinary Medical Association.

However, the strategy used to manage these areas still involves increasing the size of protected areas, while not considering the habitat characteristics and requirements of the species. In this study, during a 3-year period, camera trap and habitat characteristic surveys were used to estimate composition, diversity, and habitat characteristics of mammals to determine habitat characteristics or increase the size of protected areas what should be considered first for mammals’ conservation in a nonprotected area near the Huangshan Mountains in Anhui Province, China. From June 2017 to October 2019, 18 species of mammals were recorded, more than in any other protected area nearby. The linear model analysis results showed that habitat characteristics of mammals were different and showed a significant correlation with their relative abundance. Most species were related to vegetation characteristics, except primates (Macaca thibetana), and rodents (Leopoldamys edwardsi). Therefore, to establish conservation policies for nonprotected areas, habitat characteristics should be of prime concern, followed by increasing the size of protected areas to provide effective refuge areas for species conservation. © 2021 The Authors.

While digital repeat photography is gaining increased attention for obtaining field phenology observations, colour indices derived from this method are often affected by leaf colour and actual canopy structure, complicating the physical interpretation of results. In addition, repeated photography requires power, storage capacity and remote data transfer, which are often limited in forest conditions. As an alternative, we tested a simple, cheap and fast solution to derive daily canopy structure observation from digital camera traps (CTs). Formerly deployed for wildlife monitoring, CTs are low-cost digital cameras designed for outdoor conditions and have low battery consumption, enable repeat acquisition, and often feature remote data transfer protocols. The trial was performed in a deciduous oak stand, where continuous images were acquired over a 1-year period using the time-lapse feature of the CT. Daily time series of canopy structure attributes were derived from the collected images using simple and automated procedures. Results were validated against reference manual cover photography measurements. The daily time series of foliage cover and leaf area index were then used to derive phenological transition dates, which were compared against phenological observations obtained from satellite Sentinel-2 data. Results indicated that field and satellite data provided comparable accuracy in determining the start of season (SOS). Larger discrepancies were found in determining the end of season (EOS), which can be attributed to the low number of good quality autumn images available from the satellite data. We concluded that CT is a robust method, which is ideally suited for routine, continuous field monitoring of canopy attributes and phenology. While this method can be used for evaluating remote sensing observations, the combination of CTs with satellite data holds great potential for greater spatiotemporal coverage, from field to landscape scales. © 2021","Camera trapping; Digital cover photography; Phenological transition; Repeat photography; Trail camera","forest canopy; forest dynamics; leaf area index; observational method; phenology; remote sensing; satellite data; trap (equipment); wild population","Alivernini, A., Fares, S., Ferrara, C., Chianucci, F., An objective image analysis method for estimation of canopy attributes from digital cover photography (2018) Trees, 32 (3), pp. 713-723; Asner, G.P., Scurlock, J.M.O., Hicke, J.A., Global synthesis of leaf area index observations: implications for ecological and remote sensing studies (2003) Global Ecol.

Illegal harvest primarily involved young birds and eggs taken from nests. After the discovery of these activities, surveillance camps and camera traps connected to the mobile Global System for Mobile communications network were established in nine Bonelli's eagle breeding sites in which illegal harvest was reported. Surveillance activities resulted in a sharp reduction in illegal harvest that has contributed to the recent increase in population size and number of breeding pairs of Bonelli's eagle in the island. This population represents 95% of the entire Italian population and is catalogued as Critically Endangered in this country. Importantly, our results highlight the impact of illegal harvest on the population dynamics of endangered species as demonstrated by a population viability analysis. This is particularly important in the case of insular species for which demographic recovery due to immigration from other geographic areas is unlikely. Systematic patrols by forestry police authorities, a resolute application of Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species legislation via legal punishment, and the requirement of including all live captive specimens used for falconry in an obligatory DNA data bank would contribute to reducing the risk of extinction for small populations of endangered species of birds of prey. © 2017 The Zoological Society of London","Bonelli's eagle; falconry; illegal harvest; illegal trade; nest surveillance; population viability analysis; raptors","demography; endangered species; extinction risk; international trade; nature conservation; nest; population dynamics; population viability analysis; raptor; species conservation; trafficking; Italy; Sicily; Aquila; Aves; Falco biarmicus; Falconidae; Neophron percnopterus; Raptores","Arrigoni Degli Oddi, E., (1929) Ornitologia Italiana, , Milano, Hoepli, (in Italian); Baker, S.E., Cain, R., Van Kesteren, F., Zommers, Z.A., D'cruze, N., Macdonald, D.W., Rough trade: animal welfare in the global wildlife trade (2013) Bioscience, 63, pp. 928-938; Barov, B., Derhé, M., (2011) Review of the implementation of species action plans of threatened birds in the European Union (2004–2010), , http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/conservation/wildbirds/action_plans/docs/Final%20report%20BirdLife%20review%20SAPs.pdf, Final Report., BirdLife International; (2011) IUCN Red List for birds, , http://www.birdlife.org; (2016) Species factsheet: Aquila fasciata, , http://www.birdlife.org; Buij, R., Nikolaus, G., Whytock, R., Ingram, D.J., Ogada, D., Trade of threatened vultures and other raptors for fetish and bushmeat in West and Central Africa (2016) Oryx, 50, pp. 606-616; Calvario, E., Gustin, M., Sarrocco, S., Gallo-Orsi, U., Bulgarini, F., (1999) New Red Lists of the breeding birds in Italy, , Rome, Italy, LIPU/BirdLife – WWF; Carrete, M., Sánchez-Zapata, A., Tella, J.L., Gil-Sánchez, J.M., Moleón, M., Components of breeding performance in two competing species: habitat heterogeneity, individual quality and density-dependence (2006) Oikos, 112, pp. 680-690; Chevallier, C., Hernández-Matías, A., Real, J., Vincent-Martin, N., Ravayrol, A., Besnard, A., Retrofitting of power lines effectively reduces mortality by electrocution in large birds: an example with the endangered Bonelli's eagle (2015) J.

However, surveys determining their distribution range were carried out long ago and, due to various threats they have been decimated from many areas where they used to thrive earlier. This demands for a reassessment of their present status across its reported distribution range. Here we report the presence of fishing cats (through camera trap evidence) for the first time from a human-dominated wetland habitat of Murshidabad district, West Bengal, India. Out of all camera-trap images in the present study (N = 39), majority are of fishing cats Prionailurus viverrinus (25 pictures, 64.10%) followed by golden jackal Canis aureus (12 pictures, 30.76%), and jungle cat Felis chaus (two pictures, 5.12%). None of these wild fauna were recorded during day time. Fishing cats and golden jackals were mostly recorded between 21:01–3:00 h and 18:00–21:00 h respectively. Two images of jungle cats were also captured, one each during 21:01–00:00 h and 00:01–3:00 h. Similar studies in other wetlands within the distributional range of fishing cats will collectively validate their present distribution, which might be useful for in-situ conservation of this elusive vulnerable species. © 2020, Zoological Society, Kolkata, India.","Camera traps; Conservation; First report; Fishing cat; Human-dominated area; Murshidabad","","Adhya, T., Status survey of Fishing Cat (Prionailurus viverrinus) in Howrah and Hooghley (2011) West Bengal, Intermediate Report Submitted to the Small Grants Programme, WWF, , http://awsassets.wwfindia.org/downloads/status_survey_of_fishing_cats.pdf, India, Accessed 12 September 2019; Agrawal, V.C., Das, P.K., Chakraborty, S., Ghose, R.K., MandaI, A.K., Chakraborty, T.K., Poddar, A.K., Ghosh, M.K., Mammalia (1992) State Fauna Series 3: Fauna of West Bengal (Part I), pp. 27-169. , Zoological Survey of India, Kolkata; Anonymous, (1972) The Wildlife (Protection) Act, , Professional Book Publishers, New Delhi; Barik, S.S., Mazumdarsaha, G.K., Composition and richness of avifauna in a suburban landscape of mid West Bengal, India (2019) Wings of Life: Genomics, Biodiversity and Life Processes, pp. 178-207. , ed.

Varying detection probabilities among device locations must be accounted for when analyzing such data, which is generally done using occupancy models. We introduce a Bayesian time-dependent observation model for camera trap data (Tomcat), suited to estimate relative event densities in space and time. Tomcat allows to learn about the environmental requirements and daily activity patterns of species while accounting for imperfect detection. It further implements a sparse model that deals well will a large number of potentially highly correlated environmental variables. By integrating both spatial and temporal information, we extend the notation of overlap coefficient between species to time and space to study niche partitioning. We illustrate the power of Tomcat through an application to camera trap data of eight sympatrically occurring duiker Cephalophinae species in the savanna – rainforest ecotone in the Central African Republic and show that most species pairs show little overlap. Exceptions are those for which one species is very rare, likely as a result of direct competition. © 2021 The Authors.

The WPI targets communities of terrestrial forest and savanna birds and mammals that occupy top trophic levels in their ecosystems. To develop a WPI, the chapter begins with a camera trap survey designed to be (i) spatially representative of the area of interest, (ii) of sufficient sampling intensity to detect a representative sample of the species in the target community, and (iii) of sufficient duration to develop unbiased occupancy estimates for the sampled species. Then, it presents a preliminary bootstrapping analysis of the WPI to examine the precision and robustness of the index. The WPI is a cost-effective alternative to line transect surveys, and probably other labour-intensive surveys, producing more data and more representative data for less cost. Finally, the chapter talks about strengths and weaknesses of the WPI. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Biodiversity indicator; Camera trap surveys; Ecosystem; Mammals; Preliminary bootstrapping analysis; Savanna birds; Trophic levels; Wildlife picture index (WPI)","","Andelman, S.J., Fagan, W.F., Umbrellas and flagships: Efficient conservation surrogates or expensive mistakes (2000) Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the USA, 97, pp. 5954-5959; Balmford, A., Crane, P., Dobson, A., Green, R.E., Mace, G.M., The 2010 challenge: data availability, information needs and extraterrestrial insights (2005) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Series B, 360, pp. 221-228; Buckland, S.T., Magurran, A.E., Green, R.E., Fewster, R.M., Monitoring change in biodiversity through composite indices (2005) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Series B, 360, pp. 243-254; Caro, T.M., O'Doherty, G., On the use of surrogate species in conservation (1999) Conservation Biology, 13, pp. 805-814; Ceballos, G., Ehrlich, P.R., Mammal population losses and the extinction crisis (2002) Science, 296, pp. 904-907; Collen, B., Konie, J., Rist, J., Howard, R., (2008), p. 22. , Constructing the evidence base for pygmy hippo conservation in Sapo National Park, Liberia.

Activity patterns are shaped by physiological constraints, evolutionary history, circadian and seasonal changes and may be influenced by other factors, including ecological competition and interspecific interactions. Remote-sensing camera traps allow the collection of species presence data throughout the 24 h period and for almost indefinite lengths of time. Here, we collate data from 10 separate camera trap surveys in order to describe circadian and seasonal activity patterns of 10 mammal species, and, in particular, to evaluate interspecific (dis)associations of five predator-prey pairs. We recorded 8,761 independent detections throughout Northern Ireland. Badgers, foxes, pine martens and wood mice were nocturnal; European and Irish hares and European rabbits were crepuscular; fallow deer and grey and red squirrels were diurnal. All species exhibited significant seasonal variation in activity relative to the timing of sunrise/sunset. Foxes in particular were more crepuscular from spring to autumn and hares more diurnal. Lagged regression analyses of predator-prey activity patterns between foxes and prey (hares, rabbits and wood mice), and pine marten and prey (squirrel and wood mice) revealed significant annual and seasonal cross-correlations. We found synchronised activity patterns between foxes and hares, rabbits and wood mice and pine marten and wood mice, and asynchrony between squirrels and pine martens. Here, we provide fundamental ecological data on endemic, invasive, pest and commercially valuable species in Ireland, as well as those of conservation importance and those that could harbour diseases of economic and/or zoonotic relevance. Our data will be valuable in informing the development of appropriate species-specific methodologies and processes and associated policies.

On the Pacific coast of North America, diminished runs of salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) drive numerous marine-terrestrial interactions, many of which have been intensively studied, but marine-terrestrial interactions driven by other species remain relatively unknown. Bears (Ursus spp.) are major vectors of salmon into terrestrial ecosystems, but their participation in other cross-ecosystem interactions is similarly poorly described. Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), a migratory forage fish in coastal marine ecosystems of the North Pacific Ocean and the dominant forage fish in British Columbia (BC), spawn in nearshore subtidal and intertidal zones. Spawn resources (eggs, milt, and spawning adults) at these events are available to coastal predators and scavengers, including terrestrial species. In this study, we investigated the interaction between American black bears (Ursus americanus) and Pacific herring at spawn events in Quatsino Sound, BC, Canada. Results: Using remote cameras to monitor bear activity (1,467 camera days, 29 sites, years 2010-2012) in supratidal and intertidal zones and a machine learning approach, we determined that the quantity of Pacific herring eggs in supratidal and intertidal zones was a leading predictor of black bear activity, with bears positively responding to increasing herring egg masses. Other important predictors included day of the year and Talitrid amphipod (Traskorchestia spp.) mass. A complementary analysis of black bear scats indicated that Pacific herring egg mass was the highest ranked predictor of egg consumption by bears. Pacific herring eggs constituted a substantial yet variable component of the early springtime diet of black bears in Quatsino Sound (frequency of occurrence 0-34%; estimated dietary content 0-63%). Other major dietary items included graminoids (grasses and sedges), Phaeophyta (brown algae), Zosteraceae (seagrasses), and Talitrid amphipods. Conclusion: This research represents the first scientific evidence of a cross-ecosystem interaction between Pacific herring and American black bears. Our findings also expand knowledge of the ecological roles of both species. Combined, evidence of anthropogenic constraints on both black bears and Pacific herring suggests that bear-herring interactions were potentially stronger and more widespread in the past. © 2015 Fox et al.","Clupea pallasii;

The time needed to manually analyze these images will always be a limiting factor for experimental design and analysis. Implementation of computer vision algorithms for automating the detection and counting of animals reduces the manpower needed to analyze field images. For this paper, we assess the ability of computer vision to detect and count birds in images from a field test that was not designed for computer vision. Using video stills from the field test and Matlab's Computer Vision Toolbox, we designed and evaluated a cascade object detection method employing Haar and Local Binary Pattern feature types. Without editing the images, we found that the Haar feature can have a recall over 0.5 with an Intersection over Union threshold of 0.5. However, using this feature, 86% of the frames without birds had false-positive bird detections. Reducing the false positives could lead to these detection methods being implemented into a fully automated system for detecting and counting birds. Accurately detecting and counting birds using computer vision will reduce manpower for field experiments, both in experimental design and data analysis. Improvements in automated detection and counting will allow researchers to design extended trials without the added step of optimizing the experimental setup and/or captured images for computer vision. © 2019 The Authors.

Deep learning is a machine-learning algorithm and widely used to identify empty camera trap images automatically. Existing methods with high accuracy are based on millions of training samples (images) and require a lot of time and personnel costs to label the training samples manually. Reducing the number of training samples can save the cost of manually labeling images. However, the deep learning models based on a small dataset produce a large omission error of animal images that many animal images tend to be identified as empty images, which may lead to loss of the opportunities of discovering and observing species. Therefore, it is still a challenge to build the DCNN model with small errors on a small dataset. Using deep convolutional neural networks and a small-size dataset, we proposed an ensemble learning approach based on conservative strategies to identify and remove empty images automatically. Furthermore, we proposed three automatic identifying schemes of empty images for users who accept different omission errors of animal images. Our experimental results showed that these three schemes automatically identified and removed 50.78%, 58.48%, and 77.51% of the empty images in the dataset when the omission errors were 0.70%, 1.13%, and 2.54%, respectively. The analysis showed that using our scheme to automatically identify empty images did not omit species information. It only slightly changed the frequency of species occurrence. When only a small dataset was available, our approach provided an alternative to users to automatically identify and remove empty images, which can significantly reduce the time and personnel costs required to manually remove empty images. The cost savings were comparable to the percentage of empty images removed by models. © 2021 The Authors.

Estimating density is complicated if the species of interest has cryptic markings and occupies dense habitat. Sitatunga is such a species, specially adapted to the dense swamps and marshes of sub-Saharan Africa, where traditional population survey techniques have been ineffective. In this study, we used camera traps to estimate density of sitatunga in central Uganda using both spatial capture-recapture methods and time in front of the camera (TIFC). We collected data in three years, 2015–2017. The TIFC model resulted in density estimates similar to the spatial capture-recapture models, without needing information on movement or individual identification. However, spatial capture-recapture models provide an estimate of movement and home range, which is of interest to management. For sitatunga, spatial capture-recapture models revealed higher movement parameters and higher heterogeneity in movement than previously reported. These results illustrate the utility of camera traps for a cryptic species in dense habitats, and provide a potential alternative to spatial capture-recapture methods. © 2020 The Author(s)","Camera traps; Density estimation; Sitatunga; Tragelaphus; Uganda; Wetlands","","Agha, M., Batter, T., Bolas, E.C., Collins, A.C., Gomes da Rocha, D., Monteza-Moreno, C.M., A review of wildlife camera trapping trends across Africa (2018) Afr.

Behavioral studies in wild populations often require that animals are live trapped before behavioral observation can occur, and this is especially true in studies investigating animal personalities. However, it is unknown whether the amount of time confined to a live trap may regulate the behavior of trapped individuals. Specifically, if the duration of trap confinement directly influences behavior, then by obtaining wild animals through live trapping we may be confounding the very measurements of greatest interest. To investigate whether the duration of trap confinement influences the behavior of trapped individuals, we performed a study on two small mammal species, focusing specifically on personality traits. We positioned high-definition trail cameras facing Longworth small mammal traps in the field to observe capture events and record the time of capture. We then measured personality in captured deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and southern red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi) using three standardized tests, and through linear and generalized linear models we found that the time an animal had spent confined to a trap before testing did not affect 86% of behaviors exhibited. Our results showed two weak behavioral effects of confinement duration on boldness and docility resulting from an interaction between the duration of confinement and whether or not an individual was naïve to trapping. Our results suggest that behavioral measurements of wild, trapped small mammals are not determined by the time spent confined to a trap. However, researchers should use caution and consider whether an animal is naïve to trapping during analysis since habituation to the live trap may play a role in the effects of confinement duration on behavior. © 2020 Brehm et al.

We conducted three trials to optimise camera traps for detecting numbats (Myrmecobius fasciatus), a 500-700-g mammal. We compared detection rates from (1) Reconyx PC900 camera traps installed at heights ranging from 10-45 cm, and (2) Reconyx PC900, Swift 3C standard and wide-angle camera traps with differing detection zone widths. Finally, we compared elevated, downward-angled time-lapse cameras installed at heights ranging from 1-2 m to obtain dorsal images for individual numbat identification. Camera traps set at 25 cm had the highest detection rates but missed 40% of known events. During model comparison, Swift 3C wide-angle camera traps recorded 89%, Swift 3C standard 51%, and Reconyx PC900 37% of known events. The number of suitable images from elevated, downward-angled cameras, depicting dorsal fur patterns, increased with increasing camera height. The use of well regarded camera trap brands and generic recommendations for set-up techniques cannot replace rigorous, species-specific testing. For numbat detection, we recommend the Swift 3C wide-angle model installed at 25-cm height. For individual numbat identification, elevated, downward-angled time-lapse cameras were useful&semi; however, more research is needed to optimise this technique. &copy; 2021 Journal Compilation Australian Mammal Society Open Access. © 2021 CSIRO.

Infected plants are scored by visual assessment based on severity and extent of infection. This manual process is time intensive and not practical for large acreages. Diseased and stress in plants show elevated canopy temperatures that can potentially lead to identification of unhealthy plants without manual scoring. The infection decreases nutrient distribution causing stress that results in internal plant temperature to increase. Thermal infrared (TIR) sensors have the ability to measure the emitted radiation of an object in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum to estimate canopy temperatures. However, TIR sensors have not yet been utilized to capture changes in canopy temperatures to detect SDS in soybean. Therefore, the goal of this study was to (1) use a TIR sensor to assess plant health and vitality, and (2) evaluate canopy temperatures over the growing season to quantify disease development. A thermal infrared camera was mounted on a small unmanned aerial system to capture aerial imagery over the growing season. The first flight was achieved once SDS foliar symptoms began initial development. The remaining three flights occurred before, during, and after full pod fill when symptoms had reached their apex. Results show increasing correlations over the four days. Elevated canopy temperature changes were observed on canopies at early SDS symptom development. Symptoms at the end of the growing season displayed strong correlations to the canopy temperature with ρ = 0.7404. Disease severity showed the strongest correlation throughout the four flights with the last at ρ = 0.7245. The four flights exhibit a decreasing trend with Spearman's rho (R2 = 0.86 for disease severity). Therefore, thermal imaging can be utilized to detect diseased plots. Future studies will be conducted to understand how to mitigate for SDS using thermal detection. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","","Aerial photography; Antennas; Diagnosis; Infrared radiation; Plants (botany); Electromagnetic spectra; Initial development; Nutrient distributions; Sudden death syndromes; Symptom development; Thermal infrared cameras; Thermal infrared imaging; Unmanned aerial systems; Thermography (imaging); canopy architecture; crop yield; disease severity; growing season; infectious disease; remote sensing; satellite imagery; soybean; symptom; temperature; Fusarium virguliforme; Glycine max","Alves, I., Pereira, L.S., Non-water-stressed baselines for irrigation scheduling with infrared thermometers: a new approach (2000) Irrigat.

Because P. concolor is the largest feline in central México, puma’s presence is an indicator of ecological integrity. Our objective was to compare puma and bobcat density in a conserved area within the reserve. We deployed 15 camera stations along the ridge and a dry riverbed in Mount Tepetroja in tropical dry forest. To estimate population density, we used capture-recapture models and analyzed images from 1 May 2013 to 30 April 2017 with MARK software and CAPTURE tool. For puma, we obtained a density of 6.8 ind/100 km2 in an effective trapping area (ETA) of 70 km2, and a mean maximum distance moved (MMDM) of 2.46 ± 0.45 km. For bobcat, our population density estimate (15.4 ind/100 km2 in ETA of 38 km2) and MMDM (1.76 ± 0.41 km) is the first for central Mexico in conserved native vegetation. Puma abundance was lower compared to bobcat abundance in the reserve’s tropical dry forest; therefore, we infer that the wild felids' density is determined by their body size in an ecosystem with ecological integrity. © 2021 Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

Alcalde Rovira Roure 191, Lleida, 25198, Spain","Automated pheromone dispensers disrupt the mating behaviour of pest moths by releasing pheromone during their daily activity period, which is not the same for all target species. These periods usually occur in or close to night time and last just a few hours, so automated sampling devices are needed to characterize them. However, the commercially available automated models do not provide enough temporal resolution for characterizing the short diel periods of sexual activity of moths. Thus, we built and tested a relatively cheap and simple high-temporal-resolution image-sensor insect trap. It consisted of a Raspberry Pi computer with an infrared camera operated by open-source software and housed in a plastic box. The Raspberry Pi was powered by a solar panel and rechargeable battery that were mounted on a solid and weather-proof structure made of cheap materials. Pictures were downloaded by WiFi from the Raspberry’s SD card to a computer. Six traps baited either with synthetic sex pheromone or with females of Grapholita molesta (Busk) were tested in the field. The traps were sturdy, reliable and easy to use, taking pictures at 10 min intervals, 24 h a day for over two months. These pictures confirmed previous results regarding the period of sexual activity of the oriental fruit moth, which will aid in determining the optimal time for operating automated pheromone dispensers. © 2021.

Yet, insects' parasites can impact the fitness and activity of the bees. Since their activity is critical to the repellent ability against elephants, this study assessed the impact of small hive beetles (Aethina tumida) on bee (Apis mellifera adansonii) reproduction and ability to keep forest elephants (Loxodonta africana cyclotis) away. Because interspecies interactions are not easy to investigate, we have used camera traps and digital video to observe the activity of bees and their interactions with wild forest elephants under varying conditions of hive infestation with the small hive beetle, a common bee pest. Our results show that queen cells are good visual indicators of colony efficiency on keeping away forest elephants. We give evidences that small hive beetles are equivalently present in large and small bee colonies. Yet, results show no worries about the use of bees as elephant deterrents because of parasitism due to small hive beetles. Apis mellifera adansonii bees seem to effectively cope with small hive beetles showing no significant influence on its reproduction and ability to keep elephants away. This study also reports for the first time the presence of Aethina tumida as a constant beekeeping pest that needs to be addressed in Gabon. © Nature Conservation Research 2018.

Estimates of population abundance are needed to effectively manage common species and to conserve vulnerable species. Camera traps have advanced as wildlife monitoring tools for ungulates and can provide improved methods of estimating population abundance. Little is known, however, about how camera traps set for ungulates compare with traditional methods (e.g., ground and aerial surveys) used simultaneously. From 2012 to 2014, we captured and radio collared 34 female and 32 male bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) in a closed population in Utah, USA. Each collar had a unique letter and number combination. We then estimated number of young, females and yearlings, males and population abundance using multiple methods simultaneously: helicopter surveys, resight surveys performed from the ground, camera trap surveys using marked but not individually identifiable individuals and camera trap surveys using marked and individually identifiable animals. All methods estimated similar abundance. Across years, ages and sexes, however, camera trap surveys produced the most consistent and precise estimates of abundance for adult females and yearlings, lambs and the population. That method was less intrusive and safer than helicopter surveys. Our results indicate that camera trap surveys using photographs of marked animals in which the majority of the population visits a specific resource can produce precise estimates of abundance that are safer, as well as less intrusive and expensive than traditional methods. Using camera traps also creates a permanent record of photographs that can be archived and reanalyzed to answer future ecological and population questions. Finally, this method of estimating abundance can be used in other areas with ungulates that congregate around resources (e.g., watering sites or mineral licks). © 2021 The Authors.

Camera trap (CT) data can be used to estimate animal distribution, density, and behaviour. Attractants, such as scent lures, are often used in an effort to increase CT detections; however, the degree which the effects of attractants vary across species is not well understood. We investigated the effects of scent lure on mammal detections by comparing detection rates between 404 lured and 440 unlured CT stations sampled in Alberta, Canada over 120 day survey periods between February and August in 2015 and 2016. We used zero-inflated negative binomial generalized linear mixed models to test the effect of lure on detection rates for a) all mammals, b) six functional groups (all predator species, all prey, large carnivores, small carnivores, small mammals, ungulates), and c) four varied species of management interest (fisher, Pekania pennanti; gray wolf, Canis lupus; moose, Alces alces; and Richardson’s ground squirrel; Urocitellus richardsonii). Mammals were detected at 800 of the 844 CTs, with nearly equal numbers of total detections at CTs with (7110) and without (7530) lure, and variable effects of lure on groups and individual species. Scent lure significantly increased detections of predators as a group, including large and small carnivore sub-groups and fisher specifically, but not of gray wolf. There was no effect of scent lure on detections of prey species, including the small mammal and ungulate sub-groups and moose and Richardson’s ground squirrel specifically. We recommend that researchers explicitly consider the variable effects of scent lure on CT detections across species when designing, interpreting, or comparing multi-species surveys. Additional research is needed to further quantify variation in species responses to scent lures and other attractants, and to elucidate the effect of attractants on community-level inferences from camera trap surveys. © 2020 Holinda et al.

We used simultaneous radiotelemetry (4 males and 3 females) and camera trapping to examine the spatial structure and dynamics of a population of this species in the Brazilian pampas (part of the Uruguayan Savannah ecoregion), including assessment of interindividual genetic relatedness. Home ranges (HRs) and core areas of males were larger than those of females. Males were significantly heavier than females, and linear regression analyses indicated that body mass of males significantly influenced HR size, whereas the relationship was not significant for females. When we performed a joint analysis comparing our data to those reported previously for other study sites, we observed the same patterns. We detected extensive HR and core area overlap among most of our monitored individuals, with no clear sex-based pattern. Moreover, our molecular data indicated that most of the sampled individuals were unrelated, and that the levels of HR and core area overlap were not significantly influenced by genetic relatedness. These results suggest that some interindividual tolerance and relaxation in territoriality may occur in Geoffroy's cat. We detected only minor changes in HR and core area size and overlap between seasons, indicating that the spatial structure we observed was temporally stable. On a broader perspective, our cross-site comparisons illustrate the usefulness of performing multiple ecological studies employing comparable methods at different locations to better understand the ecology of wild felid populations. © 2018 American Society of Mammalogists.","","body mass; comparative study; ecoregion; felid; home range; Neotropic Ecozone; population dynamics; population structure; radiotelemetry; relatedness; savanna; social behavior; spatial analysis; territoriality; trapping; wild population; Argentina; Brazil; Pampas; Uruguay; Felidae; Oncifelis geoffroyi","Beausoleil, R.A., Koehler, G.M., Maletzke, B.T., Kertsen, B.N., Wielgus, R.B., Research to regulation: Cougar social behavior as a guide to management (2013) Wildlife Society Bulletin, 37, pp. 680-688; Bivand, R., (2018) The Package Maptools for R Software: Tools for Reading and Handling Spatial Objects; Boldrini, I.I., A flora dos campos do Rio Grande do sul (2009) Campos Sulinos-conservacaõ e Uso Sustentável da Biodiversidade, pp. 63-77. , (V.

However, whether PA networks actually conserve biodiversity, and how surrounding landscape features impact their efficacy, is controversial. We used a landscape approach to test whether mammalian biodiversity is maintained locally in PA networks, and whether landscape disturbance in the surrounding matrix detrimentally impacts biodiversity. We measured mammalian biodiversity using camera traps and functional diversity metrics, an approach that could be broadly applied to PA networks in working landscapes globally. We used generalized linear models to relate mammalian biodiversity metrics to natural, anthropogenic, and protected habitats across a range of 20 spatial scales to encompass increasing amounts of matrix. Biodiversity metrics increased with proportion of natural habitats at small scales and decreased with anthropogenic disturbance at large scales surrounding PAs. We found the conservation value of PAs are largely determined by the natural habitat remaining undisturbed, and the degree and type of disturbance in the surrounding working landscape. Implementing protected areas in degraded ecosystems, without addressing that degradation, will likely not achieve mammalian biodiversity conservation goals. We suggest, to achieve Aichi objectives, PAs placed in areas of high natural habitat and mitigated development will provide the best value for mammalian biodiversity conservation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Ecological neighborhood; Functional diversity; Mammals; Protected areas; Spatial scale; Working landscape","biodiversity; disturbance; landscape; mammal; protected area; species diversity; Mammalia","Alberta Status Listing, Alberta Wild Species General Status Listing (2015), http://aep.alberta.ca/fish-wildlife/species-at- risk/albertas-species-at-risk-strategy/general-status-of-alberta-wild- species/documents/SAR-2015WildSpeciesGeneralStatusList-Mar2017.pdf, (Accessed June 1, 2017); Amarasekare, P., Competitive coexistence in spatially structured environments: a synthesis (2003) Ecol.

Fragmentation by roads has had negative impacts on Fennoscandian alpine ecosystems, with reduction of habitats and connectivity for alpine species. Concurrently, infrastructure development causes influx of subsidies through roadkills and litter, which may facilitate expansion of boreal scavenging species, such as the red fox Vulpes vulpes, which may intensify negative interactions with alpine species. Hence, understanding the impact of subsidies within marginal alpine areas is imperative for successful conservation and management of particularly vulnerable alpine species. We used snow tracking and camera traps in three alpine tundra areas in Norway to investigate whether the presence of boreal scavengers was positively associated with highways during winter, and if this contrasted the pattern of a critically endangered alpine species, the Arctic fox Vulpes lagopus. In summer, artificial nests were used to assess whether predation risk was related to proximity to highways. During winter, the occurrence of red foxes was higher close to highways and decreased with increasing distance to highways, while the arctic fox showed no discernible pattern. Red fox occurrence increased with the number of edible items of anthropogenic origin located along highways, whereas arctic fox occurrence decreased. The overall predation risk of artificial nests during summer was high (>31.2%) and increased with proximity to the highway in the area with highest traffic volume. Synthesis and applications. Highways crossing alpine areas may attract boreal scavengers, possibly connected to increased access to subsidies of anthropogenic origin. Litter and food waste dominated available subsidies along highways in our study, and prevailing mitigating measures directed at reducing roadkill and movement restrictions may not be applicable to reduce negative effects of littering. We recommend actions focusing on informational campaigns, improved garbage disposal facilities and routines, and imposing fines for littering, to reduce negative impacts on vulnerable species. This is likely needed to achieve goals of ‘no impact’ from the physical loss of habitats due to road development. © 2020 The Authors.

The behavior characteristics and population density of this species are important in answering this question, but these traits have not been fully elucidated to date. Camera-capture methods have been used widely in recent years to characterize or calculate population density with the advantage of simple operation and nonintrusive investigation. However, establishing the relationship between actual population density and monitoring data with the condition that individual identification is not possible is a major challenge for this method. In this study, a model composed of a behavioral module and a burrow system module is proposed and applied to simulate the moving path of each individual pika. Based on Monte Carlo method, the model is used to develop the relationship between population density and recorded capture number, which is compared with the results derived from the random encounter model (REM) based on field observations. The simulated results mixed with the calculated density based on observation data could reach R2 = 0.98 using linear fitting, with proper parameter settings. A novel index named activity intensity of pikas per population density is also proposed, providing information on both the ecological physical characteristics and monitoring space. The influence of different parameters on this index, mainly the pika number per burrow system, pika activity time outside the burrow, and activity intensity, is discussed. The proposed methodology can be applied to different scenarios in further studies when behavioral characteristics of pikas change for such reasons as climate change and vegetation degradation. © 2021 The Authors.

In recent decades, the wildcat has slowly returned to much of its original range and may have even expanded into new areas that were not known to be occupied before. For the implementation of efficient conservation actions, reliable information about the status and trend of population size and density is crucial. But so far, only one reliable estimate of density in Switzerland was produced in the northern Swiss Jura Mountains. Wildcats are relatively rare and elusive, but camera trapping has proven to be an effective method for monitoring felids. We developed and tested a monitoring protocol using camera trapping in the northern Jura Mountains (cantons of Bern and Jura) in an area of 100 km2. During 60 days, we obtained 105 pictures of phenotypical wildcats of which 98 were suitable for individual identification. We identified 13 individuals from both sides and, additionally, 5 single right-sided flanks and 3 single left-sided flanks that could not be matched to unique individuals. We analyzed the camera-trap data using the R package multimark, which has been extended to include a novel spatial capture–recapture model for encounter histories that include multiple “noninvasive” marks, such as bilaterally asymmetrical left- and right-sided flanks, that can be difficult (or impossible) to reliably match to individuals. Here, we present this model in detail for the first time. Based on a “semi-complete” data likelihood, the model is less computationally demanding than Bayesian alternatives that rely on a data-augmented complete data likelihood. The spatially explicit capture–recapture model estimated a wildcat density (95% credible interval) of 26 (17–36) per 100 km2 suitable habitat. Our integrated model produced higher abundance and density estimates with improved precision compared to single-sided analyses, suggesting spatially explicit capture–recapture methods with multiple “noninvasive” marks can improve our ability to monitor wildcat population status. © 2020 The Authors.

Cases of hypopigmentation have been documented in many neotropical mammals, including the tayra (Eira barbara Linnaeus, 1758). We expand the account of anomalous coloration occurrence presenting new registers of hypopigmented tayras in Brazil. Data was collected during a mammal survey carried out in three agricultural landscapes within the Cerrado domain in the northeast of the state of São Paulo. We obtained two kinds of records of hypopigmented tayras, one from direct sighting and the other from a camera-trap. We discuss the likely implications of this conspicuous coloration to tayras and highlight some possibilities of study. © 2019, Universidade Estadual de Campinas UNICAMP.

Still and video camera surveillance can generate enormous quantities of data, which is laborious and expensive to screen for the species of interest. In the present study, we describe a state-of-the-art, deep learning approach for automatically identifying and isolating species-specific activity from still images and video data. We used a dataset consisting of 8,368 images of wild and domestic animals in farm buildings, and we developed an approach firstly to distinguish badgers from other species (binary classification) and secondly to distinguish each of six animal species (multiclassification). We focused on binary classification of badgers first because such a tool would be relevant to efforts to manage Mycobacterium bovis (the cause of bovine tuberculosis) transmission between badgers and cattle. We used two deep learning frameworks for automatic image recognition. They achieved high accuracies, in the order of 98.05% for binary classification and 90.32% for multiclassification. Based on the deep learning framework, a detection process was also developed for identifying animals of interest in video footage, which to our knowledge is the first application for this purpose. The algorithms developed here have wide applications in wildlife monitoring where large quantities of visual data require screening for certain species. © 2019 The Authors.

Box 6125, Morgantown, WV  26506, United States","The substantial decline of Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus) in the southern Appalachian Mountains has been attributed in part to poor recruitment with possible links to nesting ecology. However, despite extensive research, the incubation ecology of Ruffed Grouse remains poorly understood. During 1999-2001 in West Virginia, we used videography of nesting female Ruffed Grouse to (1) quantify incubation constancy (minutes on the nest/minutes recorded) and nest survival during incubation, (2) determine whether incubation constancy predicts hatch success (proportion of eggs hatched per clutch), (3) determine the effect of the onset of laying on incubation constancy and hatch success, and (4) quantify nest visitors and depredation. Females spent about 96% of the recorded time incubating their clutches. Average incubation time per day increased by 1 h between day 1 and day 24 of incubation. Females generally left their nests twice daily, once in the morning between 0700 and 1000 for 31.7 ± 2.4 minutes (standard error) and again in the evening between 1600 and 1800 for 33.6 ±1.5 minutes. Daily survival of nests (99.3 ± 0.4%) and nest survival for the incubation period (84.9 ± 9.3%) were high. Hatch success (the proportion of eggs that hatched among nests where at least one hatched) was high: 94.9 ± 0.02%. We found no relation between incubation constancy and hatch success. We recorded American Black Bear (Ursus americanus), Raccoon (Procyon lotor), and Long-tailed Weasel (Mustela frenata) as nest predators.","Appalachian Mountains; Bonasa umbellus; Hatch success; Incubation constancy; Incubation ecology; Infrared cameras; Nesting behaviour; Predation; Ruffed Grouse; West Virginia","behavior; gamebird; hatching; incubation; mountain environment; nesting; predator-prey interaction; videography; Appalachians; United States; West Virginia; Bonasa umbellus; Mustela frenata; Procyon; Procyon lotor; Ursus americanus","Aidley, D.J., (1971) The Physiology of Excitable Cells, , Cambridge University Press, London, UK; Batt, B.D.J., Cornwell, G.W., The effects of cold on Mallard embryos (1972) Journal of Wildlife Management, 36, pp. 745-751; Best, L.B., Stauffer, D.F., Factors affecting nesting success in riparian bird communities (1980) Condor, 82, pp. 149-158; Boag, D.A., Reebs, S.G., Schroeder, M.A., Egg loss among spruce grouse inhabiting lodgepole pine forests (1984) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 62, pp. 1034-1037; Bosque, C., Bosque, M.T., Nest predation as a selective factor in the evolution of developmental rates in altricial birds (1995) American Naturalist, 145, pp. 234-260; Bump, G., Darrow, R.W., Edminster, F.C., Crissey, W.F., (1947) The Ruffed Grouse: Life History, Propagation & Management, , New York State Conservation Department, Albany, New York, USA; Coates, P.S., Delehanty, D.J., Effects of environmental factors on incubation patterns of greater sage-grouse (2008) Condor, 110, pp. 627-638; Coates, P.S., Connelly, J.W., Delehanty, D.J., Predators of greater sage-grouse nests identified by video monitoring (2008) Journal of Field Ornithology, 79, pp. 421-428; Cody, M.L., A general theory of clutch size (1966) Evolution, 20, pp. 174-184; Conway, C.J., Martin, T.E., Evolution of passerine incubation behavior: Influences of food, temperature, and nest predation (2000) Evolution, 54, pp. 670-685; Conway, C.J., Martin, T.E., Effects of ambient temperature on avian incubation behavior (2000) Behavioral Ecology, 11, pp. 178-188; Cooper, C.B., Voss, M.A., Avian incubation patterns reflect temporal changes in developing clutches (2013) PLoS ONE, 8 (6), p. e65521; Dessecker, D.R., McAuley, D.G., Importance of early successional habitat to ruffed grouse and American woodcock (2001) Wildlife Society Bulletin, 29, pp. 456-465; Devers, P.K., Stauffer, D.F., Norman, G.W., Steffen, D.E., Whitaker, D.M., Sole, J.D., Allen, T.J., Tefft, B.C., Ruffed grouse population ecology in the Appalachian Region (2007) Wildlife Monographs, 168, pp. 1-36; Dinsmore, S.J., White, G.C., Knopf, F.L., Advanced techniques for modeling avian nest survival (2002) Ecology, 83, pp. 3476-3488; Dobony, C.A., Edwards, J.W., Ford, W.M., Allen, T.J., Nesting success of ruffed grouse in West Virginia (2001) Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the Southeastern Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, 55, pp. 456-465; Drent, R.H., Functional aspects of incubation in the Herring Gull (1970) Behaviour (Supplement), 17, pp. 1-132; Eaton, S.W., Wild Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo).

In recent decades they have become a tool of choice in wildlife research and monitoring. The variability between camera trap models and the methods used are considerable, and little is known about how animals respond to camera trap emissions. It has been reported that some animals show a response to camera traps, and in research this is often undesirable so it is important to understand why the animals are disturbed. We conducted laboratory based investigations to test the audio and infrared optical outputs of 12 camera trap models. Camera traps were measured for audio outputs in an anechoic chamber; we also measured ultrasonic (n = 5) and infrared illumination outputs (n = 7) of a subset of the camera trap models. We then compared the perceptive hearing range (n = 21) and assessed the vision ranges (n = 3) of mammals species (where data existed) to determine if animals can see and hear camera traps. We report that camera traps produce sounds that are well within the perceptive range of most mammals' hearing and produce illumination that can be seen by many species. © 2014 Meek et al.","","acoustic analysis; animal behavior; animal experiment; Article; auditory threshold; camera trap; controlled study; electrical equipment; hearing; illumination; infrared radiation; loudness; mammal; nonhuman; ultrasound; vision; animal; devices; hearing; photography; physiology; procedures; videorecording; vision; Animalia; Animals; Hearing; Mammals; Photography; Video Recording; Vision, Ocular","Caughley, G., (1977) Analysis of Vertebrate Populations, , London: John Wiley & Son; Swann, D.E., Hass, C.C., Dalton, D.C., Wolf, S.A., Infrared-triggered cameras for detecting wildlife: An evaluation and review (2004) Wildlife Society Bulletin, 32, pp. 357-365; Cutler, T.L., Swann, D.E., Using remote photography in wildlife ecology: A review (1999) Wildlife Society Bulletin, 27, pp. 571-581; Kucera, T.E., Barrett, R.H., A history of camera trapping (2011) Camera Traps in Animal Ecology, pp. 9-26. , O'Connell AF, Nichols JD, Karanth KU, editors New York: Springer; Long, R.A., MacKay, P., Zielinski, W.J., Ray, J.C., (2008) Noninvasive Survey Methods for Carnivores, , Washington DC, USA: Island Press; Séquin, E.S., Jaeger, M.M., Brussard, P.F., Barrett, R.H., Wariness of coyotes to camera traps relative to social status and territory boundaries (2003) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 81, pp. 2015-2025; Wegge, P., Pokheral, C.P., Jnawali, S.R., Effects of trapping effort and trap shyness on estimates of tiger abundance from camera trap studies (2004) Animal Conservation, 7, pp. 251-256; Schipper, J., Camera-trap avoidance by kinkajous potos flavus: Rethinking the ""non-invasive"" paradigm (2007) Small Carnivore Conservation, 36, pp. 38-41; Larrucea, E.S., Brussard, P.F., Jaeger, M.M., Barrett, R.H., Cameras, coyotes, and the assumption of equal detectability (2007) The Journal of Wildlife Management, 71, pp. 1682-1689; Mahon, P.S., Bates, P.B., Dickman, C.R., Population indices for wild carnivores: A critical study in sand-dune Habitat, South-Western Queensland (1998) Wildlife Research, 25, pp. 217-217; Caughley, G., Sinclair, A.R.E., (1994) Wildlife Ecology and Management, , Massachusetts: Blackwell Science; Lehner, P.N., Krumm, R., Cringan, A.T., (1976) Tests for Olfactory Repellents for Coyotes and Dogs, 40, pp. 145-150; Windberg, L.A., Coyote responses to visual and olfactory stimuli related to familiarity with an area (1996) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 74, pp. 2248-2253; Gibeau, M.L., McTavish, C., Not-so-candid cameras: How to prevent camera traps from skewing animal behaviour (2009) The Wildlife Professional, pp. 35-37; Meek, P.D., Pittet, A., User-based design specifications for the ultimate camera trap for wildlife research (2012) Wildlife Research, 39, pp. 649-660; Neitz, J., Geist, T., Jacobs, G.H., Color vision in the dog (1989) Visual Neuroscience, 3, pp. 119-125; Newbold, H.G., King, C.M., Can a predator see 'invisible' light?

However, little work has been conducted in flammable ecosystems where spatially and temporally dynamic fire edges are expected to influence animal activity patterns, particularly for animals reliant on vegetation for cover, foraging or nesting. We quantified the response of ground-dwelling mammals to fire edges and sought to determine whether animal activity mirrored temporal changes in regenerating understorey vegetation. We used a space-for-time substitution sampling design and selected a series of 26 treatment sites burnt by prescribed fire, where time since fire ranged from 0 to 7 years. Ten long-unburnt sites acted as controls. At each treatment site we identified a burnt/unburnt edge and used camera traps and Elliott traps to survey ground-dwelling mammals on either side. Habitat structure was measured at all 36 sites. We used general and generalised linear mixed models to determine the response of both habitat and animals to time since fire on both burnt and unburnt sides of edges. In addition, we used a resource selection index to assess the congruence between changes in understorey complexity and animal activity identified in the first set of analyses. On the unburnt side of the edge understorey complexity remained constant over time. On the burnt side understorey complexity followed a hump-shaped trend, peaking at 3 years post-fire where it exceeded the level of complexity on the unburnt edge. Larger animals with general resource requirements were more active at burnt compared to unburnt edges immediately after fire, but similarly active on both sides of fire edges from three years post-fire. Despite some activity on the burnt side of edges immediately after fire, small mammals were generally less active on burnt edges compared to unburnt edges for up to three years. Native species’ activity did not follow patterns of temporal change in structurally complex understorey vegetation. For all species, selection was strongest at recently burnt edges with little vegetation and substantially lower at 3–7 year old regenerating edges where understorey complexity was higher. In general, patterns of selection on the unburnt side of edges were similar over time. Our findings suggest that vegetation change on the burnt side of fire edges may not be a good predictor of native mammal use. Foxes and cats, exotic predators in our system, were also using the burnt edge more than expected immediately after fire. Immediate post-fire predation may be higher at fire edges than elsewhere, and recently burnt edge zones could be suitable locations for integrated predator and fire management. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity; Edge effects; Fire ecology; Fire management; Mammals","Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Forestry; Housing; Mammals; Vegetation; Edge effect; Environmental features; Fire ecology; Fire management; Habitat structures; Linear mixed models; Resource requirements; Understorey vegetation; Fires; agricultural land; edge effect; fire management; habitat use; mammal; resource selection; small mammal; understory; urban ecosystem; vegetation cover; vegetation dynamics; Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Fires; Forestry; Mammals; Plants; Animalia; Canidae; Mammalia","Banks, S.C., Dujardin, M., McBurney, L., Blair, D., Barker, M., Lindenmayer, D.B., Starting points for small mammal population recovery after wildfire: recolonisation or residual populations?

We present a model to estimate the density of unmarked populations, which considers species’ space use. The model assumes that animal movements depend on space use probability. Using a hypothetical animal population, we carried out a set of computer simulations on individual movements and camera-trap monitoring to estimate population density with sampling data. Our results demonstrated that the model performed well, and highlighted the importance of adding space use information into density estimation approaches. We also tested the effect of multiple variables (i.e., day range, no. of camera traps, time span of monitoring duration) on density estimates. Increasing the number of camera traps and monitoring duration may reduce the variance of density estimate. Precision of density estimates increased when the species’ day range increased. Subject to accurate measurement of model parameters, this method provides a potential approach to estimate unmarked population density using camera-trap data. © 2020 The Wildlife Society. © 2020 The Wildlife Society","computer simulation;

The present survey of the literature is aimed at identifying the applications of AI methods (machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision) to symbiotic organisms including the associations of both macro and microorganisms. It was relevant to extend this review to applications in metagenomic and image data analysis, those being the dominant methods in the study of environmental impacts to symbiosis. The survey involved 161 papers from 2020-2021to draw conclusions. This analysis revealed that the application of AI methods is crucial for both metagenomic and image data (camera and remote sensing data) analysis for taxon identification, interaction, and phenotyping, and biomonitoring studies in almost all symbiotic associations from bacteria, lichens to coral reefs. The survey further revealed that AI methods have been adopted for inferring the environmental impacts because they can overcome some of the difficulties associated with modelling highly dimensional and nonlinear environmental data with complex interactions. These methods proved to be especially useful if the sample size was small, has mixed data types, or missing values and can be applied to reduce computation time. Different supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as random forest, support vector machines, k-mers, etc. are being applied at every step in metagenomic data analysis, from the taxonomic assignment, binning to gene and functional annotation, and are gradually replacing the manual methods with automated AI-based annotation. Similarly, the applications of deep learning and computer vision algorithms e.g., convolutional neural network are progressing steadily towards automation of image annotation in the monitoring of marine and terrestrial symbiosis. However, before we can use these methods to their full potential in understanding the multidimensional effects of environmental factors including the impact of anthropogenic activities, there are several gap areas. For example, the identification of novel and cryptic species, limited reference databases, and big data challenges, need to be addressed with further research. There needs to be better communication between biologists and machine learning research communities so that good quality labelled data is generated in future experiments. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Arbuscular mycorrhiza; Coral reef; Image data; Machine learning; Metagenomics; Microbiome; Pixels; Remote sensing data; Symbiosis","anthropogenic effect; artificial intelligence; automation; biomonitoring; computer vision; holistic approach; machine learning; remote sensing; symbiosis","Automated quality control of next generation sequencing data using machine learning.

Community science, satellite remote sensing (SRS), and local forms of remote sensing (e.g., camera traps and acoustic recordings) have enabled biological data to be collected at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales and resolution. There is growing interest in developing observation networks to collect and synthesize data to improve broad-scale ecological monitoring, but no examples of such networks have emerged to inform decision-making by agencies. Here, we present the implementation of one such jurisdictional observation network (JON), Snapshot Wisconsin, which links synoptic environmental data derived from SRS to biodiversity observations collected continuously from a trail camera network to support management decision-making. We use several examples to illustrate that Snapshot Wisconsin improves the spatial, temporal, and biological resolution and extent of information available to support management, filling gaps associated with traditional monitoring and enabling consideration of new management strategies. JONs like Snapshot Wisconsin further strengthen monitoring inference by contributing novel lines of evidence useful for corroboration or integration. SRS provides environmental context that facilitates inference, prediction, and forecasting, and ultimately helps managers formulate, test, and refine conceptual models for the monitored systems. Although these approaches pose challenges, Snapshot Wisconsin demonstrates that expansive observation networks can be tractably managed by agencies to support decision making, providing a powerful new tool for agencies to better achieve their missions and reshape the nature of environmental decision-making. © 2021 The Authors.

However, there is limited empirical evidence quantifying how the features of their design and broader placement within the landscape influence use by target fauna. In this study, we took a multi-scale approach to investigating the use of chainsaw hollows (CHs) by a target native arboreal marsupial, Krefft's Glider Petaurus notatus. We hypothesized that Krefft's Gliders would respond to attributes of: (1) the CH itself; (2) the tree into which it was installed; and (3) the habitat within the reserve in which it was located. We monitored occupancy (over 2.7 years, using a pole camera) of 48 CHs installed in live Eucalyptus trees across multiple reserves in Melbourne, Australia, plus visitation (over ∼3 months, using camera traps) to 40 of the CHs. Mixed models were used to relate the occupancy of CHs by Krefft's Gliders to field-collected data on various attributes of CHs at all three scales. From a total of 35,219 visitations across the 40 CHs, we recorded 13 native hollow-dependent species (five mammals, eight birds) visiting CHs. During 14 pole-camera inspections, Krefft's Glider occupied 60% of the 48 CHs at least once, with 4% used as maternal dens during breeding. Four exotic species were also recorded visiting and/or occupying CHs. Orientation and volume both significantly affected occupancy: Krefft's Gliders were more likely to occupy larger CHs, and those facing north and west (possibly related to microclimate). Tree-scale attributes did not affect occupancy, but Krefft's Gliders were more likely to occupy CHs further from reserve edges, and where local density of Black Wattles (Acacia mearnsii: an important food resource) and low vegetation cover (100–200 cm above ground) was increased. Our findings show that CHs can provide supplementary shelters for Krefft's Gliders when natural hollows are limited. Practitioners should consider both the physical characteristics of the cavity (e.g. volume) and the surrounding habitat (e.g. availability of foraging resources) to enhance the use of CHs by target species. The ongoing availability of CHs to target species will also be influenced by their use by exotic species, and potential for closure as woundwood grows. In an Australian context, a lack of knowledge about the specific features of natural hollows to which hollow-dependent fauna respond, means it is critical for policy and management to prioritize the retention of mature hollow-bearing trees. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Cavity-dependent fauna; Habitat restoration; Krefft's Glider; Petauridae; Petaurus notatus; Supplementary hollow","Cameras; Conservation; Forestry; Mammals; Poles; Restoration; Cavity-dependent fauna; Chainsaws; Exotic species; Habitat restoration; Krefft glider; Petauri notatu; Petauridae; Supplementary hollow; Target species; Tree cavities; Ecosystems; arboreal species; habitat availability; habitat use; marsupial; shelter; Cameras; Conservation; Ecosystems; Forestry; Mammals; Restoration; Australia; Acacia mearnsii; Eucalyptus; Mammalia; Metatheria; Petauridae; Petaurus","Anderson, D.L., Koomjian, W., French, B., Altenhoff, S.R., Luce, J., Review of rope-based access methods for the forest canopy: safe and unsafe practices in published information sources and a summary of current methods (2015) Methods Ecol.

Development involved the use of thermal imaging cameras combined with spotlight transect surveys of an endangered greater glider population at Seven Mile Beach National Park. Over 30 h of nocturnal spotlight transect surveys were undertaken over 14 (1 km) transects within 70 ha of dry sclerophyll forest. A protocol for the use of thermography to survey greater gliders was developed. The efficacy of the thermography protocol was then experimentally tested in comparison to traditional spotlighting. Overall, thermography was better at detecting arboreal mammals than spotlighting (P < 0.05). However, the effect was not significant for greater gliders (P = 0.79), even though there was a trend towards improved detection of the species using thermal cameras. Thermography is a novel approach to undertaking arboreal mammal surveys and future studies should consider its relevance, effectiveness and associated costs to improve survey designs, especially for threatened species. © 2020 Australian Mammal Society.","glider; Petauroides volans; possum; thermography","","Allen, M., Webb, M.

Study designs, particularly for small-bodied or cryptic wildlife species often attempt to boost low detection probabilities by using non-random camera placement or baited cameras, which may bias data, or incorrectly estimate detection and occupancy. We investigated the ability of non-baited, multi-camera arrays to increase detection probabilities of wildlife. Study design components were evaluated for their influence on wildlife detectability by iteratively parsing an empirical dataset (1) by different sizes of camera arrays deployed (1-10 cameras), and (2) by total season length (1-365 days). Four species from our dataset that represented a range of body sizes and differing degrees of presumed detectability based on life history traits were investigated: white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), bobcat (Lynx rufus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), and Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana). For all species, increasing from a single camera to a multi-camera array significantly improved detection probability across the range of season lengths and number of study sites evaluated. The use of a two camera array increased survey detection an average of 80% (range 40-128%) from the detection probability of a single camera across the four species. Species that were detected infrequently benefited most from a multiple-camera array, where the addition of up to eight cameras produced significant increases in detectability. However, for species detected at high frequencies, single cameras produced a season-long (i.e, the length of time over which cameras are deployed and actively monitored) detectability greater than 0.75. These results highlight the need for researchers to be critical about camera trap study designs based on their intended target species, as detectability for each focal species responded differently to array size and season length. We suggest that researchers a priori identify target species for which inference will be made, and then design camera trapping studies around the most difficult to detect of those species. © 2017 O'Connor et al.

Here, we review the opportunities and challenges that such technology might afford in the field of conservation and ecology. SmallSat constellations may yield higher resolutions than those that are currently available to scientists and practitioners, increasing opportunities to improve environmental-monitoring and animal-tracking capabilities. They may cut access costs to end users, by reducing operational costs and bringing increased competition to the existing market. Their greater flexibility and affordability may moreover enable the development of bespoke constellations for specific conservation and ecological applications, and provide greater interoperability with ground-based sensors, such as tracking devices and camera traps. In addition, SmallSats may serve as cost-effective research and development platforms for new components and products. Combined, these benefits could significantly improve our ability to monitor threats to the environment as they unfold, while enhancing our understanding of animal ecology and ecosystem dynamics. However, significant hardware and software developments are required before such technology is able to produce, process and handle reliable and cost-effective data, and the initial research and development costs still represent a major challenge. Further, we argue that much remains to be done to ensure these new data products become accessible, equitable and sustainable. © 2021 The Authors.

Live-trapping, measures of facial and faecal pollen loads, and footage from remote cameras facing the inflorescences confirmed that all three are visited by small mammals and specialist nectarivorous birds. These plant species have bowl-shaped inflorescences that produce highly concentrated (34.1–42.9%) sucrose-rich nectar and a “yeasty” scent, typical traits of small-mammal pollinated plants. Camera footage indicated that 140 visits were made by eight small mammal species to an accumulative 19 inflorescences of the three Protea species. Small mammals thus made up 69% of total visits by all vertebrate species. Camera footage revealed that Micaelamys namaquensis visited flowers more frequently than any other vertebrate visitor (41% of total visitations by birds and mammals) but Elephantulus edwardii (10% of total visitations by birds and mammals) spent the longest time foraging on inflorescences (~ 28 s per inflorescence). The ‘trap shy’ species, Graphiurus ocularis, was observed for the first time on camera, visiting Protea humiflora and Protea sulphurea inflorescences. Galerella pulverulenta (Cape gray mongoose) also visited inflorescences of P. canaliculata. The remaining 31% of total vertebrate visits, primarily to Protea humiflora, were by three species of specialist nectarivorous birds (the Cape sugarbird Promerops cafer, and the shorter-billed sunbirds, Anthobaphes violacea and Cinnyris chalybeus). Breeding system experiments with Protea sulphurea revealed that pollinators are needed for seed set, although exclusion of vertebrate pollinators only marginally lowered seed set of this partially self-incompatible species. These three Protea species had asynchronous flowering periods, supporting a wide range and relative abundance (overall live mammal trapping success rate of 22.7% nocturnal and 5.7% diurnal species) of vertebrate pollinators over a three month period in winter. That these Protea species co-occur suggests there is a community of vertebrate flower visitor species and primarily small mammal-pollinated plant species. The partitioning of nectar resources over a long period has conservation implications for both the plants and animals. © 2017 SAAB","Graphiurus ocularis; Protea; Proteaceae; Remote cameras; Small mammal pollination; Specialist sunbird pollinators","community structure; concentration (composition); dicotyledon; equipment; flower visiting; nectarivory; pollination; relative abundance; reproductive biology; seed set; small mammal; specialist; species occurrence; trapping; South Africa; Western Cape; Animalia; Aves; Elephantulus edwardii; Galerella pulverulenta; Graphiurus ocularis; Mammalia; Promerops cafer; Protea; Protea canaliculata; Protea humiflora; Protea sulphurea; Proteaceae; Vertebrata","Balmer, A., Fast-food for Animals — A Comprehensive Ecological Pollination Study of Non-flying Mammal Pollinated Proteas (2013), MSc thesis University of Zurich, Faculty of Science; Beattie, A.J., A technique for the study of insect-borne pollen (1971) Pan-Pacific Entomologist, 47, p. 82; Biccard, A., Midgley, J.J., Rodent pollination in Protea nana (2009) South African Journal of Botany, 75, pp. 720-725; BirdLife, Anysberg nature reserve (2015), http://www.birdlife.org.za/component/k2/item/250-sa108-anysberg-nature-reserve, Available online (Accessed 5 October 2017); Bond, W.J., Ferguson, M., Forsyth, G., Small mammal and habitat structure along altitudinal gradients in the southern Cape mountains (1980) South African Journal of Zoology, 15, pp. 34-43; Botes, C., Johnson, S.D., Cowling, R.M., Coexistence of succulent tree aloes: partitioning of bird pollinators by floral traits and flowering phenology (2008) Oikos, 117, pp. 875-882; Brown, M., Downs, C.T., Johnson, S.D., Sugar preferences and digestive efficiency in an opportunistic avian nectarivore, the dark-capped Bulbul Pycnonotus tricolor (2010) Journal für Ornithologie, 151, pp. 637-643; Collins, B.G., Rebelo, T., Pollination biology of the Proteaceae in Australia and southern Africa (1987) Austral Ecology, 12, pp. 387-421; De Graaf, C., The Rodents of Southern Africa: Notes on Their Identification, Distribution, Ecology and Taxonomy (1981), Butterworth & Co (SA) (PTY) (LTD) Durban, South Africa; Fenster, C.B., Armbruster, W.S., Wilson, P., Dudash, M.R., Thomson, J.D., Pollination syndromes and floral specialization (2004) Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics, 35, pp. 375-403; Fleming, P., Nicolson, S., How important is the relationship between Protea humiflora (Proteaceae) and its non-flying mammal pollinators?

This study evaluates the efficacy and robustness of occupancy models based on camera trap data, and two locally informed methods: seasonal interviews and hunter diaries, for monitoring 13 hunted mammal species in south-eastern Cameroon. We triangulate estimates of detectability and occupancy to assess the precision and comparability of their estimates for different species, and their cost. Camera trap estimates are comparable with estimates from locally informed methods in 7 of 11 available cases, but produced the lowest detection probabilities for all species in both villages. While camera traps provide robust estimates for abundant species with a high detection probability, locally informed methods can provide estimates of occupancy comparable to camera trap estimates, but at significantly less cost. They are particularly useful where camera trap detection rates (p) are too low to produce robust occupancy model estimates, notably for rare or cryptic species. The methods, survey effort and animals that can be monitored robustly vary between villages. As such, consideration should be given before monitoring commences to ensure that the most effective and informative approach is used. © 2022 The Authors.

Wildlife monitoring by camera traps is an established and non-invasive standard approach to quantify species diversity, estimate occupancy and relative abundance and track animal behaviour in 24/7 documentation. We propose a novel wildlife-specific 3D multi-object tracking workflow using inexpensive stereo camera traps. By embedding carefully efficient 2D methods into the overall 3D workflow, we avoid, on the one hand, costly processing of complex 3D data structures, i.e., 3D point clouds but on the other hand outperform significantly typical 2D tracking approaches with our overall 3D workflow in terms of international established multi-object tracking metrics, i.e., with respect to the reliability and accuracy of the tracking results.

The absence or extremely low densities of large-bodied vertebrates disrupts plant-animal mutualisms and consequently degrades key ecosystem services. Understanding patterns of defaunation is therefore crucial given that most tropical forests worldwide are now “half-empty”. Here we investigate changes in vertebrate community composition and size structure along a gradient of marked anthropogenic hunting pressure in the Médio Juruá region of western Brazilian Amazonia. Using a novel camera trapping grid design deployed both in the understorey and the forest canopy, we estimated the aggregate biomass of several functional groups of terrestrial and arboreal species at 28 sites along the hunting gradient. Generalized linear models (GLMs) identified hunting pressure as the most important driver of aggregate biomass for game, terrestrial, and arboreal species, as well as nocturnal rodents, frugivores, and granivores. Local hunting pressure affected vertebrate community structure as shown by both GLM and ordination analyses. The size structure of vertebrate fauna changed in heavily hunted areas due to population declines in large-bodied species and apparent compensatory increases in nocturnal rodents. Our study shows markedly altered vertebrate community structure even in remote but heavily settled areas of continuous primary forest. Depletion of frugivore and granivore populations, and concomitant density-compensation by seed predators, likely affect forest regeneration in persistently overhunted tropical forests. These findings contribute to a better understanding of how cascading effects induced by historical defaunation operate, informing wildlife management policy in tropical peri-urban, rural and wilderness areas. © 2021, The Author(s).","Birds; Camera trapping; Defaunation; Density compensation; Mammals; Wildlife","anthropogenic effect; biomass; community structure; ecological modeling; forest ecosystem; forest edge; hunting; mutualism; nocturnal activity; rodent; vertebrate; wild population; Amazonia; Mammalia; Vertebrata","Abernethy, K.A., Coad, L., Taylor, G., Extent and ecological consequences of hunting in Central African rainforests in the twenty-first century (2013) Philos Trans R Soc B; Abrahams, M.I., Peres, C.A., Costa, H.C.M., Measuring local depletion of terrestrial game vertebrates by central-place hunters in rural Amazonia (2017) PLoS ONE, 12, pp. 1-25; (2019) Agencia Nacional Das Aguas (ANA, , https://www.ana.gov.br/.Accessed3; Antunes, A.P., Fewster, R.M., Venticinque, E.M., Empty forest or empty rivers?

Each camera trap study generates a vast amount of data, which need to be processed and labeled before analysis. Traditionally, processing camera trap data has been performed manually by entering data into a spreadsheet. This is time-consuming, prone to human error, and data management may be inconsistent between projects, hindering collaboration. Recently, several programs have become available to facilitate and quicken data processing. Here, we review available software and assess their ability to better standardize camera trap data management and facilitate data sharing and collaboration. To identify available software for camera trap data management, we used internet searches and contacted researchers and practitioners working on large camera trap projects, as well as software developers. We tested all available programs against a range of software characteristics in addition to their ability to record a suite of important data variables extracted from images. We identified and reviewed 12 available programs for the management of camera trap data. These ranged from simple software assisting with the extraction of metadata from an image, through to comprehensive programs that facilitate data entry and analysis. Many of the programs tested were developed for use on specific studies and so do not cover all possible software or data collection requirements that different projects may have. We highlight the importance of a standardized software solution for camera trap data management. This approach would allow all possible data to be collected, enabling researchers to share data and contribute to other studies, as well as facilitating multi-project comparisons. By standardizing camera trap data collection and management in this way, future studies would be better placed to guide conservation policy on a global level. © 2018 The Authors.

For example, some species do not have natural marks that can reliably produce individual identities from photographs, and some methods of observation produce partial identity samples as is the case with remote cameras that sometimes produce single-flank photographs. Unmarked SCR, SMR, and SPIM share the feature that they probabilistically resolve the uncertainty in individual identity using the spatial location where samples were collected. Spatial location is informative of individual identity in spatially structured populations because a sample is more likely to have been produced by an individual living near the trap where it was recorded than an individual living further away from the trap. Further, the level of information about individual identity that a spatial location contains is related to two key ecological concepts, population density and home range size, which we quantify using a proposed Identity Diversity Index (IDI). We show that latent and partial identity SCR models produce imprecise and biased density estimates in many high IDI scenarios when data are sparse. We then extend the unmarked SCR model to incorporate categorical, partially identifying covariates, which reduce the level of uncertainty in individual identity, increasing the reliability and precision of density estimates, and allowing reliable density estimation in scenarios with higher IDI values and with more sparse data. We illustrate the performance of this “categorical SPIM” via simulations and by applying it to a black bear data set using microsatellite loci as categorical covariates, where we reproduce the full data set estimates with only slightly less precision using fewer loci than necessary for confident individual identification. We then discuss how the categorical SPIM can be applied to other wildlife sampling scenarios such as remote camera surveys, where natural or researcher-applied partial marks can be observed in photographs. Finally, we discuss how the categorical SPIM can be added to SMR, 2-flank SPIM, or other latent identity SCR models. © 2019 The Authors.","genetic mark–recapture; Identity Diversity Index; microsatellites; partial identity; spatial capture–recapture; spatial mark–resight; unmarked spatial capture–recapture","","Augustine, B.C., (2018) SPIM R package, , https://github.com/benaug/SPIM; Augustine, B.C., Royle, J.A., Kelly, M.J., Satter, C.B., Alonso, R.S., Boydston, E.E., Crooks, K.R., Spatial capture-recapture with partial identity: an application to camera traps (2018) Annals of Applied Statistics, 11, pp. 67-95; Bonner, S.J., Holmberg, J., Mark-recapture with multiple, non-invasive marks (2013) Biometrics, 69, pp. 766-775; Borchers, D.L., Efford, M., Spatially explicit maximum likelihood methods for capture–recapture studies (2008) Biometrics, 64, pp. 377-385; Chandler, R.B., Clark, J.D., Spatially explicit integrated population models (2014) Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 5, pp. 1351-1360; Chandler, R.B., Royle, J.A., Spatially explicit models for inference about density in unmarked or partially marked populations (2013) Annals of Applied Statistics, 7, pp. 936-954; Clink, D.J., Bernard, H., Crofoot, M.C., Marshall, A.J., Investigating individual vocal signatures and small-scale patterns of geographic variation in female bornean gibbon (Hylobates muelleri) great calls (2017) International Journal of Primatology, 38, pp. 656-671; Cowen, L., Schwarz, C.J., The Jolly-Seber model with tag loss (2006) Biometrics, 62, pp. 699-705; Efford, M., Density estimation in live-trapping studies (2004) Oikos, 106, pp. 598-610; Efford, M., Dawson, D.K., Jhala, Y., Qureshi, Q., Density-dependent home-range size revealed by spatially explicit capture–recapture (2016) Ecography, 39, pp. 676-688; Efford, M., Mowat, G., Compensatory heterogeneity in spatially explicit capture—recapture data (2014) Ecology, 95, pp. 1341-1348; Fieberg, J., Kochanny, C.O., Quantifying home-range overlap: the importance of the utilization distribution (2005) Journal of Wildlife Management, 69, pp. 1346-1359; Gelman, A., Rubin, D.B., Inference from iterative simulation using multiple sequences (1992) Statistical science, 7, pp. 457-472; Knapp, S.M., Craig, B.A., Waits, L.P., Incorporating genotyping error into non-invasive DNA-based mark–recapture population estimates (2009) Journal of Wildlife Management, 73, pp. 598-604; Laake, J., Burnham, K., Anderson, D., (1993) Distance sampling: estimating abundance of biological populations, , Chapman & Hall, London, UK; Lewis, J.S., Logan, K.A., Alldredge, M.W., Bailey, L.L., VandeWoude, S., Crooks, K.R., The effects of urbanization on population density, occupancy, and detection probability of wild felids (2015) Ecological Applications, 25, pp. 1880-1895; McCarthy, T.M., Waits, L.P., Mijiddorj, B., Status of the Gobi bear in Mongolia as determined by noninvasive genetic methods (2009) Ursus, 20, pp. 30-38; McClintock, B.T., Conn, P.B., Alonso, R.S., Crooks, K.R., Integrated modeling of bilateral photo-identification data in mark-recapture analyses (2013) Ecology, 94, pp. 1464-1471; McIntosh, B., Dudzinski, K.M., Mercado, E., III, Do dolphins’ whistles reveal their age and sex (2015) Animal Behavior and Cognition, 2, pp. 313-333; Mills, L.S., Citta, J.J., Lair, K.P., Schwartz, M.K., Tallmon, D.A., Estimating animal abundance using noninvasive DNA sampling: promise and pitfalls (2000) Ecological Applications, 10, pp. 283-294; Molina, S., Fuller, A.K., Morin, D.J., Royle, J.A., Use of spatial capture–recapture to estimate density of Andean bears in northern Ecuador (2017) Ursus, 28, pp. 117-126; Moyer, M.A., McCown, J.W., Eason, T.H., Oli, M.K., Does genetic relatedness influence space use pattern?

Bonobos show the strongest looking impulse and are more neophobic than either gorillas or chimpanzees. Additional social and environmental effects on reactions demonstrate the complexities of animal curiosity. © 2019 Elsevier LtdTemperament and personality research in humans and nonhuman animals measures behavioral variation in individual, population, or species-specific traits with implications for survival and fitness, such as social status, foraging, and mating success [1–5]. Curiosity and risk-taking tendencies have been studied extensively across taxa by measuring boldness and exploration responses to experimental novelty exposure [3, 4, 6–15]. Here, we conduct a natural field experiment using wildlife monitoring technology to test variation in the reaction of wild great apes (43 groups of naive chimpanzees, bonobos, and western gorillas across 14 field sites in Africa) to a novel object, the camera trap. Bonobo and gorilla groups demonstrated a stronger looking impulse toward the camera trap device compared to chimpanzees, suggesting higher visual attention and curiosity. Bonobos were also more likely to show alarm and other fearful behaviors, although such neophobic (and conversely, neophilic) responses were generally rare. Among all three species, individuals looked at cameras longer when they were young, were associating with fewer individuals, and did not live near a long-term research site. Overall, these findings partially validate results from great ape novelty paradigms in captivity [7, 8]. We further suggest that species-typical leadership styles [16] and social and environmental effects, including familiarity with humans, best explain novelty responses of wild great apes. In sum, this study illustrates the feasibility of large-scale field experiments and the importance of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors in shaping animal curiosity.

Little empirical research exists, however, examining the mechanisms by which birds might be deterred from human structures. We tested the efficacy of ultraviolet (UV) lights for preventing window strikes in an urban environment by measuring their deterrence effect at bird feeders at eight residential sites. We used remote cameras to count feeder visits over one winter in response to rotating treatments comprising a pulsating UV light, a light-reflecting compact disc, an unlit UV light as a novel object, and a control with no object. Using generalized linear mixed models, we showed that feeder visit rates were influenced by wind speed, site, and site–treatment interactions. The unlit novel object treatment yielded a visitation rate significantly higher than the control (p = 0.01). The UV and passive reflecting treatments slightly increased visitation above the control (p = 0.06 and p = 0.378, respectively). This suggests that novel objects may serve as an attractant in a foraging context and that this effect is stronger than any deterrence effect of UV light. The site–treatment interaction indicated that each of the four treatments produced the highest visitation rate for at least one of the sites. Rather than offer a biological explanation for this interaction, we speculate that it resulted from a spurious effect of temporal and spatial variation in bird activity that interacted with our randomized block design. Although we found no evidence that UV lights would deter urban songbirds from anthropogenic structures, their potential to attract attention may reduce the likelihood that birds fail to see and then collide with windows. © Dt.

The most effective method to estimate a population density is always case-dependent and, thus, varies across study areas. Particularly, drive count and vantage point count estimates (i.e. counts by hunters) have been reported to be the most effective to assess deer densities in woodlands, but they require a high volunteer human presence, which limit their feasibility. Results of count by hunters were thus compared with estimates obtained through camera trapping and track counts. Surveys were all carried out between 2014 and 2015. The three-used method provided us with comparable density results, suggesting that they all may be applied in the study area. Track-count survey was shown to be—with equal effectiveness—the cheapest method to infer roe deer density in forest areas (i.e. near 28% cheaper than camera trapping). As to our study sites, we therefore suggest that the proposal of track-count method might provide wildlife managers with a cost-effective alternative to other count methods to estimate roe deer population density. However, it is noteworthy that track-count method may also lead to lower density estimates than the drive counts; an apparent difference in the accuracy between methods needs to be considered when choosing for a certain count method. © 2018, Mammal Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, Białowieża, Poland.","Camera trapping; Capreolus capreolus; Drive counts; Economic costs; Track counts; Vantage point counts","abundance estimation; cost analysis; deer; numerical method; population density; trapping; wild population; woodland; Italy; Capreolus; Capreolus capreolus; Cervidae","Acevedo, P., Ferreres, J., Jaroso, R., Duràn, M., Escudero, M.A., Marco, J., Gortàzar, C., Estimating roe deer abundance from pellet group counts in Spain: an assessment of methods suitable for Mediterranean woodlands (2010) Ecol Indic, 10, pp. 1226-1230; Ancillotto, L., Notomista, T., Mori, E., Bertolino, S., Russo, D., Assessment of detection methods and vegetation associations for introduced Finlayson’s squirrels (Callosciurus finlaysonii) in Italy (2018) Environ Manage, 61, pp. 875-883. , PID: 29468263; Andersen, R., Duncan, P., Linnell, J.D.C., (1998) The European roe deer: the biology of success, , Scandinavian University Editions, Oslo; Anile, S., Ragni, B., Randi, E., Mattucci, F., Rovero, F., Wildcat population density on the Etna volcano, Italy: a comparison of density estimation methods (2014) J Zool (Lond), 293, pp. 252-261; Aulak, W., Babińska-Werka, J., Estimation of roe deer density based on the abundance and rate of disappearance of their faeces from the forest (1990) Acta Theriol, 35, pp. 111-120; Breed, G.A., Costa, D.P., Jonsen, I.D., Robinson, P.W., Mills-Flemming, J., State-space methods for more completely capturing behavioral dynamics from animal tracks (2012) Ecol Model, 235, pp. 49-58; Cagnacci, F., Focardi, S., Heurich, M., Stache, A., Hewison, A.J.M., Morellet, N., Kjellander, N., Urbano, F., Partial migration in roe deer: migratory and resident tactics are end points of a behavioural gradient determined by ecological factors (2011) Oikos, 120, pp. 1790-1802; Cagnacci, F., Cardini, A., Ciucci, P., Ferrari, N., Mortelliti, A., Preatoni, D.G., Russo, D., Amori, G., Less is more: a researcher’s survival guide in time of economic crisis (2012) Hystrix, 23, pp. 1-7; Carbone, C., Cowlishaw, G., Isaac, N.J.B., Rowcliffe, J.M., How far do animals go?

The large volume of data such studies produce have encouraged researchers to increasingly look to computer-assisted pattern-recognition software to expedite individual identifications, but little work has been done to formally assess such software for camera-trap data. We used 2 sets of camera-trap images—359 images of jaguars (Panthera onca) and 332 images of ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) collected from camera traps deployed in 4 study sites in Orange Walk District, Belize, in 2015 and 2016—to compare the accuracy of 2 such programs, HotSpotter and Wild-ID, and assess the effect of image quality on matching success. Overall, HotSpotter selected a correct match as its top rank 71–82% of the time, whereas the rate for Wild-ID was 58–73%. Positive matching rates for both programs were highest for high-quality images (85–99%) and lowest for low-quality images (28–52%). False match rates were very low for HotSpotter (0–2%) but these were greater in Wild-ID (6–28%). When lower ranks were also considered, both programs performed similarly (overall 22–24% nonmatches for HotSpotter, 17–26% nonmatches for Wild-ID). We found that in both programs, images more often matched to other images of the same quality; therefore, including multiple reference images of an individual, of different qualities, improves matching success. These programs do not provide fully automatic identification of individuals and human involvement is still required to confirm matches, but we found that they are effective tools to expedite processing of camera-trap data. We also offer usage recommendations for researchers to maximize the benefits of these tools. © 2020 The Wildlife Society. © 2020 The Wildlife Society","camera trap; HotSpotter; jaguar; Leopardus pardalis; ocelot; Panthera onca; pattern-recognition; photographic identification; Wild-ID","analytical method; comparative study; felid; identification method; image analysis; pattern recognition; software; trapping; wildlife management; Belize [Central America]; Orange Walk; Leopardus pardalis; Panthera onca","Agresti, A., Coull, B.A., Approximate is better than “exact” for interval estimation of binomial proportions (1998) The American Statistician, 52, pp. 119-126; Baldi, B., Moore, D.S., (2014) The practice of statistics in the life sciences, , Third edition, W.

One hundred and twenty-two camera trap locations were set up for a total of 4,139 trap nights and 5,461 independent encounters were identified. The target species of Asian elephant, gaur, sambar deer, wild boar, northern red muntjac and lesser oriental chevrotain were recorded. The results show the occupancy of Asian elephant was 1.21 individuals/km2 within the study area. The probability occupancy of the Asian elephant was 70% (SE=0.06). In comparison, gaur had a probability occupancy of 57% (SE=0.07), whereas sambar deer was 79% (SE=0.04), followed by wild boar 77% (SE=0.05), northern red muntjac 77% (SE=0.05) and lesser oriental chevrotain occupancy 63% (SE=0.07). The age structure of Asian elephant between calf, juvenile, sub-adult and adult was 1: 2.1: 1.2: 3.16, and the ratio between adult males and females was 1: 1.72. The results show that roads and salt lick s ites were the essential factors affecting the chance of Asian elephants and ungulate species in the area. The habitat suitability for Asian elephant was 331 km2, while those for gaur, sambar deer, wild boar, northern red muntjac and lesser oriental chevrotain were 287.73 km2, 249.97 km2, 540.40 km2, 451.34 km2 and 434.30 km2, respectively. Recommendations for further management involve concentration on the suitable area resulting from this study. Concerning the suitability habitat, it was found that the park boundary was most suited. Therefore, habitat improvements for all large herbivorous mammal species should improve the areas within the national park an d especially address the central area, with an emphasis on creating salt lick sites, in addition to grassland and water sources that must be quality and sufficient, the most important habitat factor for these species. © 2022, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

Several studies have estimated cougar (Puma concolor) abundance using remote camera trapping in conjunction with capture-mark-recapture (CMR) type analyses. However, this methodology (photo-CMR) requires that photo-captured individuals are individually recognisable (photo identification). Photo identification is generally achieved using naturally occurring marks (e.g. stripes or spots) that are unique to each individual. Cougars, however, are uniformly pelaged, and photo identification must be based on subtler attributes such as scars, ear nicks or body morphology. There is some debate as to whether these types of features are sufficient for photo-CMR, but there is little research directly evaluating its feasibility with cougars. Aim. We aimed to examine researchers' ability to reliably identify individual cougars in photographs taken from a camera-trapping survey, in order to evaluate the appropriateness of photo-CMR for estimating cougar abundance or CMR-derived parameters. Methods. We collected cougar photo detections using a grid of 55 remote camera traps in north-west Wyoming, USA. The photo detections were distributed to professional biologists working in cougar research, who independently attempted to identify individuals in a pairwise matching process. We assessed the level to which their results agreed, using simple percentage agreement and Fleiss's kappa. We also generated and compared spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) density estimates using their resultant detection histories. Key results. There were no cases where participants were in full agreement on a cougar's ID. Agreement in photo identification among participants was low (n = 7; simple agreement = 46.7%; Fleiss's kappa = 0.183). The resultant SECR density estimates ranged from 0.7 to 13.5 cougars per 100 km2 (n = 4; s.d. = 6.11). Conclusion. We were unable to produce reliable estimates of cougar density using photo-CMR, due to our inability to accurately photo-tag detected individuals. Abundance estimators that do not require complete photo-tagging (i.e. mark-resight) were also infeasible, given the lack of agreement on any single cougar's ID. Implications. This research suggested that there are substantial problems with the application of photo-CMR to estimate the size of cougar populations. Although improvements in camera technology or field methods may resolve these issues, researchers attempting to use this method on cougars should be cautious. © CSIRO 2018.","","abundance estimation; felid; identification method; image analysis; mark-recapture method; methodology; parameter estimation; population density; population estimation; population size; United States; Wyoming; Puma concolor","Alexander, P.D., (2016) Comparing Conventional and Noninvasive Monitoring Techniques for Assessing Cougar Population Size in the Southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, , Ph.D. Thesis, Utah State University, Logan; Anderson, C.J.R., Roth, J.D., Waterman, J.M., Can whisker spot patterns be used to identify individual polar bears?

An increasingly popular solution is automated image classification software. However, most solutions are not sufficiently robust to be deployed on a large scale due to lack of location invariance when transferring models between sites. This prevents optimal use of ecological data resulting in significant expenditure of time and resources to annotate and retrain deep learning models. We present a method ecologists can use to develop optimized location invariant camera trap object detectors by (a) evaluating publicly available image datasets characterized by high intradataset variability in training deep learning models for camera trap object detection and (b) using small subsets of camera trap images to optimize models for high accuracy domain-specific applications. We collected and annotated three datasets of images of striped hyena, rhinoceros, and pigs, from the image-sharing websites FlickR and iNaturalist (FiN), to train three object detection models. We compared the performance of these models to that of three models trained on the Wildlife Conservation Society and Camera CATalogue datasets, when tested on out-of-sample Snapshot Serengeti datasets. We then increased FiN model robustness by infusing small subsets of camera trap images into training. In all experiments, the mean Average Precision (mAP) of the FiN trained models was significantly higher (82.33%–88.59%) than that achieved by the models trained only on camera trap datasets (38.5%–66.74%). Infusion further improved mAP by 1.78%–32.08%. Ecologists can use FiN images for training deep learning object detection solutions for camera trap image processing to develop location invariant, robust, out-of-the-box software. Models can be further optimized by infusion of 5%–10% camera trap images into training data. This would allow AI technologies to be deployed on a large scale in ecological applications.

Sources of broad scale occurrence datasets include crowdsourced databases, such as eBird and iNaturalist, weather surveillance radars, and passive automated sensors including acoustic monitoring units and camera trap networks. Such data resources represent static observations, typically at the species level, at a given location. Nonetheless, by combining multiple observations across many locations and times it is possible to infer spatially continuous population-level movements. Population-level movement characterizes the aggregated movement of individuals comprising a population, such as range contractions, expansions, climate tracking, or migration, that can result from physical, behavioral, or demographic processes. A desire to model population movements from such forms of occurrence data has led to an evolving field that has created new analytical and statistical approaches that can account for spatial and temporal sampling bias in the observations. The insights generated from the growth of population-level movement research can complement the insights from focal tracking studies, and elucidate mechanisms driving changes in population distributions at potentially larger spatial and temporal scales. This review will summarize current broad-scale occurrence datasets, discuss the latest approaches for utilizing them in population-level movement analyses, and highlight studies where such analyses have provided ecological insights. We outline the conceptual approaches and common methodological steps to infer movements from spatially distributed occurrence data that currently exist for terrestrial animals, though similar approaches may be applicable to plants, freshwater, or marine organisms. © 2021, The Author(s).","Acoustic monitoring; Camera trap; Crowdsourced data; eBird; Migration; Occurrence data; Population-level movement; Range expansion; Terrestrial animals; Weather surveillance radar","","Soulsbury, C.D., Iossa, G., Baker, P.J., White, P.C.L., Harris, S., Behavioral and spatial analysis of extraterritorial movements in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) (2011) J Mammal, 92 (1), pp. 190-199; Supp, S.R., Koons, D.N., Ernest, S.K.M., Using life history trade-offs to understand core-transient structuring of a small mammal community (2015) Ecosphere., 6 (10), p. art187; Van Moorter, B., Rolandsen, C.M., Basille, M., Gaillard, J.-M., Movement is the glue connecting home ranges and habitat selection (2016) J Anim Ecol, 85 (1), pp. 21-31. , PID: 25980987; Friedemann, G., Leshem, Y., Kerem, L., Shacham, B., Bar-Massada, A., McClain, K.M., Multidimensional differentiation in foraging resource use during breeding of two sympatric top predators (2016) Sci Rep, 6 (1), p. 35031. , PID: 27725734; Ahearn, S.C., Dodge, S., Simcharoen, A., Xavier, G., Smith, J.L.D., A context-sensitive correlated random walk: a new simulation model for movement (2017) Int J Geogr Inf Sci, 31 (5), pp. 867-883; Bischof, R., Loe, L.E., Meisingset, E.L., Zimmermann, B., Van Moorter, B., Mysterud, A., A migratory northern ungulate in the pursuit of spring: jumping or surfing the green wave?

This lack of distinct natural markings may lead to large error rates in the assessment of photographs, and as a consequence result in poor abundance estimates. We conducted an experiment asking expert observers to identify individual red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) from a set of photographs taken by automatic camera-traps. Our objectives were to determine whether reliable individual identification of red foxes from photographs is possible and, if possible, to improve the identification process. Exact assessment of error rates in individual identification can only be achieved if photographs of known individuals are available. This is rarely the case; therefore, we used photographs of red foxes from different study sites and determined the lower limit of the proportion of false positive matches. Our analysis, based on 10 expert responses, suggested that individual identification of red foxes is not reliable. The number of individual foxes assessed by the observers varied between 4 and 23 individuals. The minimal proportion of false positive matches was very large (>50% of the photographs considered to be of the same individual were from 2 different study sites) and there was little agreement among experts on which photographs showed the same individuals. Hence, we caution against individual identification from photographs of red foxes and other animals with similar or less natural markings without further testing. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.","Camera-trap; False positive error; Individual identification; Observer agreement; Red fox; Vulpes vulpes","abundance; canid; error analysis; felid; identification key; photograph; population density; population estimation; trap (equipment); ungulate; wildlife management","Altman, D.G., Bland, J.M., Diagnostic tests 2: Predictive values (1994) British Medical Journal, 309, p. 102; Borchers, D.L., Efford, M.G., Spatially explicit maximum likelihood methods for capture-recapture studies (2008) Biometrics, 64, pp. 377-385; Carbone, C., Christie, S., Conforti, K., Coulson, T., Franklin, N., Ginsberg, J.R., Griffiths, M., Shahruddin, N.W., The use of photographic rates to estimate densities of tigers and other cryptic mammals (2001) Animal Conservation, 4, pp. 75-79; Dillon, A., Kelly, M.J., Ocelot home range, overlap and density: Comparing radio telemetry with camera trapping (2008) Journal of Zoology, 275, pp. 391-398; Foster, R.J., Harmsen, B.J., A critique of density estimation from camera-trap data (2012) Journal of Wildlife Management, 76, pp. 224-236; Garrote, G., De Ayala, R.P., Pereira, P., Robles, F., Guzman, N., Garcia, F.J., Iglesias, M.C., Barroso, J.L., Estimation of the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) population in the Doñana area, SW Spain, using capture-recapture analysis of cameratrapping data (2011) European Journal of Wildlife Research, 57, pp. 355-362; Goswami, V.R., Madhusudan, M.D., Karanth, K.U., Application of photographic capture-recapture modelling to estimate demographic parameters for male Asian elephants (2007) Animal Conservation, 10, pp. 391-399; Heilbrunn, R.D., Silvy, N.J., Peterson, M.J., Tewes, M.E., Estimating bobcat abundance using automatically triggered cameras (2006) Wildlife Society Bulletin, 34, pp. 69-73; Kaphegyi, T., Untersuchungen zum Sozialverhalten des Rotfuchses (Vulpes vulpes L.)

These worms are hypothesized to use both luminescence and autotomization (voluntary loss of body parts) as specialized defenses against predators. Previous studies had focused on the mechanisms of light production or used human manipulation to provoke luminescent displays, rather than using actual predators. Worms and local crustacean predators collected in Cumberland County, Maine at three intertidal locations between June 2011 and March 2013 were placed in a small chamber with a removable center divider and their interaction was recorded with infrared cameras, a night vision device with an infrared barrier filter, and photomultipliers. Three different luminescent responses were observed: attached scale flashing, autotomized glowing scales, and autotomized flashing/glowing posterior segments. In some cases, autotomized scales/segments acted as successful decoys, with the anterior portion of the worm crawling away while the attacker focused on the posterior glowing portion. Worms appeared to use different combinations of defensive behaviors in different scenarios, such as when attacked by different predators. Luminescent defensive displays were also more complex than predicted and suggest that the predator’s actions during and following an attack may inadvertently aid in the scale worm’s escape. The use of live predators was pivotal to describing the worm’s defense mechanism and providing insight into how luminescence may be used in nature. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","","autotomy; crustacean; defense behavior; intertidal environment; luminescence; polychaete; predator; Cumberland County [Maine]; Maine; United States; Crustacea; Harmothoe imbricata; Polychaeta; Polynoidae","Bassot, J.-M., Nicolas, M.-T., Bioluminescence in scale-worm photosomes: the photoprotein polynoidin is specific for the detection of superoxide radicals (1995) Histochem Cell Biol, 104, pp. 199-210. , PID: 8542446; Bilbaut, A., Cell junctions in the excitable epithelium of bioluminescent scales on a polynoid worm: a freeze-fracture and electrophysiological study (1980) J Cell Sci, 41, pp. 341-368. , PID: 7364888; Bruno, M.S., Mote, M.I., Goldsmith, T.H., Spectral absorption and sensitivity measurements in single ommatidia of the green crab, Carcinus (1973) J Comp Physiol A Neuroethol Sens Neural Behav Physiol, 82, pp. 151-163; Buck, J., Case, J.F., Physiological links in firefly flash code evolution (2002) J Insect Behav, 15, pp. 51-68; Bush, S.L., Robison, B.H., Caldwell, R.L., Behaving in the dark: locomotor, chromatic, postural, and bioluminescent behaviors of the deep-sea squid Octopoteuthis deletron Young 1972 (2009) Biol Bull, 216, pp. 7-22. , PID: 19218488; Colepicolo, P., Roenneberg, T., Morse, D., Taylor, W., Hastings, W., Circadian regulation of bioluminescence in the dinoflagellate Pyrocystis lunula (1993) J Phycol, 29, pp. 173-179; Crothers, J., The biology of the shore crab, Carcinus maenas (L.). 2.

It helps researchers to process tremendous and various ecology data. Most studies focus on fine-tuning the deep learning network or altering the algorithm to enhance the identification accuracy, and some useful tools have been generated with these methods. This study focuses on the influence of image data on the recognition model. The single data set source of the existing automated identification tools is relatively simple, and the competition-based data set released only focuses on evaluating the model at present. For the first time, this article integrates butterfly image data sets from multiple sources, covered illustrated books, and popular butterfly science websites. The image types include standard specimen images, illustrated book scan images and camera shots. In addition, these images included not only fixed poses, but also various other images of butterflies in natural poses. The size of these images is also various. The testing data set is new data that does not belong to the training set, which also verifies the generalizability of the model, indicating that in practical applications this model can identify new images. This testing method is a breakthrough compared to the previous work. We designed different data sets using the ResNet18 network to train a classifier, which achieves a validation accuracy of 86% in the end of the analysis. By adjusting the data sets, the accuracy changes as well. This study provides a method to recognize hundreds of butterfly species and analyzes the testing progress from the point of view of data. It is the first to combine butterflies from multiple countries in a single data set, with a recognition accuracy that outperforms previous experiments, to the best of our knowledge. We further analyze the testing results of butterfly recognition at the family and genus level. We perform two more experiments to demonstrate the model in the case of similar species or genus. © 2022 The Entomological Society of Korea and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","","","Ando, M., Nakatsuka, S., Aizawa, H., Recognition of wildlife using deep learning in images taken by camera traps (2019) Honyurui Kagaku (Mammalian Science), 59, pp. 49-60;

Understanding the spatial distribution pattern and the habitats utilization of endangered species is a priority for developing the appropriate protection and management strategies. In this paper, the data based on the entity, feces and traces of Rusa unicolor and Budorcas taxicolor were collected with the infrared cameras and line transect method in Anzihe protected areas of Sichuan Province. Based on 124 valid sites of Rusa unicolor and 79 valid sites of Budorcas taxicolor, and combined with 15 environmental variables, the habitat suitability of Rusa unicolor and Budorcas taxicolor in the protected areas was evaluated by MaxEnt model. The results suggested that: (1) the evaluation results of habitat suitability of Rusa unicolor and Budorcas taxicolor reached a good level, and their Area Under Curve (AUC) values were 0.888 and 0.813, respectively. (2) The suitable and relatively suitable habitats of Rusa unicolor were mainly distributed in the middle and south part of the protected areas, with altitudes ranging from 1474 to 3336 m, and the areas were 943.23 hm2 and 3390.15 hm2 , respectively, accounting for 6.25% and 22.48% of the total protected areas. (3) The main sites of suitable and relatively suitable habitats of Budorcas taxicolor were mainly distributed in the middle and western part of the protected areas, where altitudes ranged between 1467 to 3823 m, and the areas were 1808.37 hm2 and 8384.35 hm2 , respectively, accounting for 11.99% and 55.59% of the total protected area. (4) The ecological overlap index of Rusa unicolor and Budorcas taxicolor was comparatively high,with the D value of 0.6739 and the I value of 0.9098. The overlap area of suitable and relatively suitable habitats reached 261.10 hm2 and 2048.41 hm2 , respectively. The overlap area, greatly affected by human activities, was mainly located around the low hills and river valleys in the middle and south of the protected areas. In the future, it is quite necessary to conduct further research on the correlation between the preferences dietary and habits of Rusa unicolor, Budorcas taxicolor, Naemorhedus goral. This will benefit the decision-making and thus result in better-informed and more robust decisions. © 2020 Science Press.

However, discharge fluctuations can result in daily stream drying and rewetting. In this study, we documented flow intermittence and resulting fish stranding and mortality over a 12-week period on an effluent-dependent reach of the lower Santa Cruz River in Tucson, Arizona, USA. We hypothesized that fish stranding would be positively related to the duration of flow prior to drying (increased recolonization potential) and flow recession rates (increased stranding likelihood). Using trail cameras, we monitored drying duration and extent along a 2.1-km reach of river known to experience flow intermittence and counted stranded fish once a week. Drying extent varied widely (range: 0–1.88 km) and averaged 0.79 km ± 0.14 SE. We observed a total of 323 fish strandings across the 12 weeks (range: 0–74 individuals per day; mean: 26.9 ± 8.3 SE). Ninety-nine percent of observed fish were Poeciliidae (63% of which were fry), including non-native western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis). The recession rate was a positive predictor for the daily stranding count of poeciliids (p =.008). Flow duration was not significant (p =.100) but was included in the top model (R2 = 0.782). As urban development continues, the discharge of effluent into rivers and streams will become more common throughout the world. Continued research is needed to understand the benefits and challenges presented by these effluent-driven flow regimes, including their impacts on aquatic taxa. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","drying; mosquitofish; urban ecology; wastewater","arid region; discharge; ecological impact; effluent; fish; pollutant transport; risk assessment; river flow; stranding; wastewater; wastewater treatment; water quality; Arizona; Santa Cruz River [Arizona]; United States; Gambusia affinis; Poeciliidae","Anderson, D.R., Burnham, K.P., Avoiding pitfalls when using information-theoretic methods (2002) The Journal of Wildlife Management, 66, pp. 912-918; Archdeacon, T.P., Reale, J.K., No quarter: Lack of refuge during flow intermittency results in catastrophic mortality of an imperiled minnow (2020) Freshwater Biology, 65 (12), pp. 2108-2123; Arthington, A.H., Balcombe, S.R., Extreme flow variability and the ‘boom and bust’ ecology of fish in arid-zone floodplain rivers: A case history with implications for environmental flows, conservation and management (2011) Ecohydrology, 4 (5), pp. 708-720; Bartoń, K., (2019) MuMIn: Multi-Model Inference.

After severe storms, rapid recovery of vegetation, especially that of dune-stabilizing plants, is a fundamental property of coastal resilience. Herbivores may affect resilience by foraging and trampling in disturbed areas. Consequently, assessing the impacts of herbivores on recovering vegetation is important for coastal land management. We combined imagery classification, wildlife monitoring, and trend analysis to investigate effects of white-tailed deer on recovery rates of vegetation four years poststorm in nine overwashed areas. We estimated local deer density with trail cameras, how it relates to an index of primary productivity, and assessed the relationship between deer density and rates of vegetation recovery in overwash fans. Prestorm vegetation cover consisted of shrubs and sporadic patches of beach grass. Poststorm cover was dominated by beach grass. At current rates, vegetation coverage will return to prestorm conditions within the decade, though community transition from grasses to shrubs will take much longer and will vary by site with dune formation. The effect of deer on rates of vegetation recovery was negative, but not statistically significant nor biologically compelling. Although effects of deer trampling on beach grass are evident in classified imagery, deer foraging on beach grass had little effect on its rate of spread throughout overwash fans. While the rate of spread of the primary dune-building grass was not deleteriously affected by deer, locally high deer densities will likely affect the future establishment and development of herbs and shrubs, which are generally more palatable to deer than beach grass. © 2019 The Authors.

Camera traps have potential for this purpose, but may have problems detecting and identifying small species. A further challenge is how to standardise the size of each camera's field of view so capture rates are comparable between different places and times. We investigated the optimal specifications for a low-cost camera trap for small mammals. The factors tested were 1) trigger speed, 2) passive infrared vs. microwave sensor, 3) white vs. infrared flash, and 4) still photographs vs. video. We also tested a new approach to standardise each camera's field of view. We compared the success rates of four camera trap designs in detecting and taking recognisable photographs of captive stoats (Mustela erminea), feral cats (Felis catus) and hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus). Trigger speeds of 0.2-2.1 s captured photographs of all three target species unless the animal was running at high speed. The camera with a microwave sensor was prone to false triggers, and often failed to trigger when an animal moved in front of it. A white flash produced photographs that were more readily identified to species than those obtained under infrared light. However, a white flash may be more likely to frighten target animals, potentially affecting detection probabilities. Video footage achieved similar success rates to still cameras but required more processing time and computer memory. Placing two camera traps side by side achieved a higher success rate than using a single camera. Camera traps show considerable promise for monitoring invasive mammal control operations. Further research should address how best to standardise the size of each camera's field of view, maximise the probability that an animal encountering a camera trap will be detected, and eliminate visible or audible cues emitted by camera traps. © 2013 Glen et al.","","animal behavior; animal trapping; article; body size; camera; cat; computer analysis; environmental monitoring; equipment design; Erinaceus europaeus; Felis catus; hedgehog; information processing; infrared radiation; intermethod comparison; invasive species; mammal; microwave radiation; Mustela erminea; nonhuman; photography; process optimization; running; species identification; standardization; videorecording; weasel; Animals; Cats; Hedgehogs; Mammals; Microwaves; Movement; Photography; Video Recording; Animalia; Erinaceidae; Erinaceus europaeus; Felis catus; Mammalia; Mustela erminea","Rowcliffe, J.M., Field, J., Turvey, S.T., Carbone, C., Estimating animal density using camera traps without the need for individual recognition (2008) J Appl Ecol, 45, pp. 1228-1236. , doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01473.x; Royle, J.A., Karanth, K.U., Gopalaswamy, A.M., Kumar, N.S., Bayesian inference in camera trapping studies for a class of spatial capture-recapture models (2009) Ecology, 90, pp. 3233-3244. , doi: 10.1890/08-1481.1; Bengsen, A.J., Leung, L.K.-P., Lapidge, S.J., Gordon, I.J., Using a general index approach to analyze camera-trap abundance indices (2011) J Wildl Manag, 75, pp. 1222-1227. , doi: 10.1002/jwmg.132; O'Brien, T.G., Kinnaird, M.F., Wibisono, H.T., Crouching tigers, hidden prey: Sumatran tiger and prey populations in a tropical forest landscape (2003) Anim Conserv, 6, pp. 131-139. , doi: 10.1017/S1367943003003172; Noss, A.J., Gardner, B., Maffei, L., Cuéllar, E., Montaño, R., Comparison of density estimation methods for mammal populations with camera traps in the Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco landscape (2012) Anim Conserv, 15, pp. 527-535. , doi: 10.1111/j.1469-1795.2012.00545.x; Lyra-Jorge, M.C., Ciocheti, G., Pivello, V.R., Meirelles, S.T., Comparing methods for sampling large- and medium-sized mammals: camera traps and track plots (2008) Eur J Wildl Res, 54, pp. 739-744. , doi: 10.1007/s10344-008-0205-8; De Bondi, N., White, J.G., Stevens, M., Cooke, R., A comparison of the effectiveness of camera trapping and live trapping for sampling terrestrial small-mammal communities (2010) Wildl Res, 37, pp. 456-465. , doi: 10.1071/WR10046; Smith, J.K., Coulson, G., A comparison of vertical and horizontal camera trap orientations for detection of potoroos and bandicoots (2012) Aust Mammal, 34, pp. 196-201. , doi: 10.1071/AM11034; Karanth, K.U., Estimating tiger Panthera tigris populations from camera-trap data using capture-recapture models (1995) Biol Conserv, 71, pp. 333-338. , doi: 10.1016/0006-3207(94)00057-W; Karanth, K.U., Nichols, J.D., Estimation of tiger densities in India using photographic captures and recaptures (1998) Ecology, 79, pp. 2852-2862. , doi: 10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[2852:EOTDII]2.0.CO;2; Nelson, J.L., Scroggie, M.P., (2009) Remote Cameras as a Mammal Survey Tool: Survey Design and Practical Considerations, , Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research Unpublished Report Number 2009/36, Heidelberg: Department of Sustainability and Environment; Latham, A.D.M., Nugent, G., Warburton, B., Evaluation of camera traps for monitoring European rabbits before and after control operations in Otago, New Zealand (2012) Wildl Res, 39, pp. 621-628; Sanders, M.D., Maloney, R.F., Causes of mortality at nests of ground-nesting birds in the Upper Waitaki Basin, South Island, New Zealand: a 5-year video study (2002) Biol Conserv, 106, pp. 225-236. , doi: 10.1016/S0006-3207(01)00248-8; Glen, A.S., Dickman, C.R., Monitoring bait removal in vertebrate pest control: a comparison using track identification and remote photography (2003) Wildl Res, 30, pp. 29-33. , doi: 10.1071/WR01059; Blackwell, G.L., Potter, M.A., McLennan, J.A., Rodent density indices from tracking tunnels, snap-traps and Fenn traps: do they tell the same story?

We demonstrate that the ages of Andean bear cubs ≤6 months old may be estimated from their size relative to their mothers with an average error of &lt; 0.01±13.2 days (SD; n = 14), and that ages of adults ≥10 years old may be estimated from the proportion of their nose that is pink with an average error of &lt; 0.01 ± 3.5 years (n = 41). We also show that similarity among the bears' natural markings, as perceived by humans, is not associated with pedigree kinship among the bears (R2 &lt; 0.001, N = 1,043, p = 0.499). Thus, researchers may use photos of wild Andean bears to estimate the ages of young cubs and older adults, but not to infer their kinship. Given that camera trap photos are one of the most readily available sources of information on large cryptic mammals, we suggest that similar methods be tested for use in other poorly understood species. © 2015 Van Horn et al.","Age estimation; Andean bear; Camera traps; Kinship; Natural markings; Noninvasive; Spectacled bear; Tremarctos ornatus","age determination; animal behavior; Article; bear; body size; consanguinity; ecology; nonhuman; nose color; photography; respiratory tract parameters; visual information; Mammalia; Tremarctos ornatus","Alvergne, A., Huchard, E., Charpentier, M.J.E., Setchell, J.M., Ruppli, C., Féjan, D., Martinez, L., Raymond, M., Human ability to recognize kin visually within primates (2009) International Journal of Primatology, 30, pp. 199-210; Aquilina, G.D., Stimulation of maternal behaviour in the Spectacled bear Tremarctos ornatus at Buffalo Zoo (1981) International Zoo Yearbook, 21, pp. 143-145; Bartareau, T.M., Larter, N.C., Cluff, H.D., Leone, E.H., Body condition and growth dynamics of American black bears in northern Canada (2012) Ursus, 23, pp. 12-20; Bateson, P., Lotwick, W., Scott, D.K., Similarities between the faces of parents and offspring in Bewick's swan and the differences between mates (1980) Journal of Zoology, 191, pp. 61-74; Berry, P.S.M., Bercovitch, F.B., Darkening coat colour reveals life history and life expectancy of male Thornicroft's giraffes (2012) Journal of Zoology, 287, pp. 157-160; Blanchard, B.M., Size and growth patters of the Yellowstone grizzly bear (1987) International Conference on Bear Research and Management, 7, pp. 99-107; Bloxam, Q., Breeding the spectacled bear Tremarctos ornatus at Jersey Zoo (1977) International Zoo Yearbook, 17, pp. 158-161; Bridges, A.S., Olfenbuttel, C., Vaughan, M.R., A mixed regression model to estimate neonatal black bear cub age (2002) Wildlife Society Bulletin, 30, pp. 1253-1258; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (2002) Model selection and multimodel inference: a practical information-theoretic approach, , 2nd edition.

Camera trap techniques are widely used for the study of mammals, but also enable investigation of other groups, such as birds. In order to evaluate the usefulness of camera trapping for the study of avifauna, we analyzed the records obtained from 12 camera traps installed between July 2015 and July 2016, near artificial water sources in Estancia Montania, Boquerón Department, Paraguay. Four of these sites were associated with xerophytic forests and eight with exotic pastures. The richness, composition and capture rate recorded in both ecosystems were determined. We compared the richness and composition of birds detected by camera traps with those obtained through auditory and visual methods. Through camera trapping, 74 species of birds were recorded, belonging to 30 families and 16 orders. The xerophytic forest and the exotic pasture have a 52.7 % similarity in species composition. With regard to capture rates, the most frequently recorded species were: Leptotila verreauxi (16.14 %), Ortalis canicollis (14.28 %) and Furnarius cristatus (11.39 %). The camera traps were effective in detecting 33% of the species identified in the area based on direct and auditory observation sampling techniques, and added two species not detected by direct methods. For this reason, camera trapping is appropriate to complement methods based on direct observation, particularly for monitoring hunted species of the Chaco ecosystem belonging to Tinamiform and Columbiform species. Due to the non-invasive nature of the technique, it constitutes an efficient method for addressing ethological studies of terrestrial species. © 2019, Universidad de Costa Rica.

The hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) requires submersion in water to aid thermoregulation and prevent skin damage by solar radiation; the largest threat to its viability are human alterations of aquatic habitats. In the Ruaha National Park (NP), Tanzania, the Great Ruaha River (GRR) is the main source of surface water for wildlife during the dry season. Recent, large-scale water extraction from the GRR by people upstream of Ruaha NP is thought to be responsible for a profound decrease in dry season water-flow and the absence of surface water along large sections of the river inside the NP. We investigated the impact of decreased water flow on daytime hippo distribution using regular censuses at monitoring locations, transects and camera trap records along a 104km section of the GRR within the Ruaha NP during two dry seasons. The minimum number of hippos per monitoring location increased with the expanse of surface water as the dry seasons progressed, and was not affected by water quality. Hippo distribution significantly changed throughout the dry season, leading to the accumulation of large numbers in very few locations. If surface water loss from the GRR continues to increase in future years, this will have serious implications for the hippo population and other water dependent species in Ruaha NP. © 2016 Stommel et al.

The challenge is that the ecologist cannot know in advance how many images per species they need to collect for model training in order to achieve their desired classification accuracy. In fact there is limited empirical evidence in the context of camera trapping to demonstrate that increasing sample size will lead to improved accuracy. In this study we explore in depth the issues of deep learning model performance for progressively increasing per class (species) sample sizes. We also provide ecologists with an approximation formula to estimate how many images per animal species they need for certain accuracy level a priori. This will help ecologists for optimal allocation of resources, work and efficient study design. In order to investigate the effect of number of training images; seven training sets with 10, 20, 50, 150, 500, 1000 images per class were designed. Six deep learning architectures namely ResNet-18, ResNet-50, ResNet-152, DnsNet-121, DnsNet-161, and DnsNet-201 were trained and tested on a common exclusive testing set of 250 images per class. The whole experiment was repeated on three similar datasets from Australia, Africa and North America and the results were compared. Simple regression equations for use by practitioners to approximate model performance metrics are provided. Generalizes additive models (GAM) are shown to be effective in modelling DL performance metrics based on the number of training images per class, tuning scheme and dataset. Overall, our trained models classified images with 0.94 accuracy (ACC), 0.73 precision (PRC), 0.72 true positive rate (TPR), and 0.03 false positive rate (FPR). Variation in model performance metrics among datasets, species and deep learning architectures exist and are shown distinctively in the discussion section. The ordinary least squares regression models explained 57%, 54%, 52%, and 34% of expected variation of ACC, PRC, TPR, and FPR according to number of images available for training. Generalised additive models explained 77%, 69%, 70%, and 53% of deviance for ACC, PRC, TPR, and FPR respectively. Predictive models were developed linking number of training images per class, model, dataset to performance metrics. The ordinary least squares regression and Generalised additive models developed provides a practical toolbox to estimate model performance with respect to different numbers of training images. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Camera traps; Deep learning; Ecological informatics; Generalised additive models; Learning curves; Predictive modelling; Wildlife","accuracy assessment; algorithm; data set; empirical analysis; image analysis; image classification; informatics; least squares method; machine learning; numerical model; prediction; Africa; Australia; North America; Animalia","Barz, B., Denzler, J., Deep Learning on Small Datasets without Pre-Training Using Cosine Loss (2020), Paper presented at The IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision; Beery, S., Van Horn, G., Perona, P., Recognition in Terra Incognita (2018), Paper presented at the European Conference on Computer Vision; Beery, S., Liu, Y., Morris, D., Piavis, J., Kapoor, A., Joshi, N., Meister, M., Perona, P., Synthetic examples improve generalization for rare classes (2020) The IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV); Cho, J., Lee, K., Shin, E., Choy, G., Do, S., How Much Data is Needed to Train a Medical Image Deep Learning System to Achieve Necessary High Accuracy?

We evaluated visits to feeders and water troughs by non-game species using camera-traps in two separate areas of Spain. Feeders and water troughs were either “protected” (when surrounded by more than 50% of shrubs/forest) or “open” (in the opposite case). A total of 18 948 photos from 5344 camera-trapping days depicted animals, and 75 species were identified. Feeders and water troughs were visited by target species (partridges and lagomorphs, 55.3% of visits) and non-target species (44.7% of visits). Among the latter, corvids were the most common (46.1% of visits), followed by rodents (26.8%), other birds (23.6%, mainly passerines), columbids (1.9%), and other species at minor percentages. The highest proportion of visiting days to feeders and water troughs was from corvids (0.173) followed by other-birds (0.109) and rodents (0.083); the lowest proportion was recorded for columbids (0.016). Use intensity and visit frequency of water troughs tripled that recorded in feeders, and visits to open feeders/troughs were approximately twice those to protected ones. In summary: feeders and water troughs targeting small game species are also used regularly by non-target ones; they should be set close to cover to optimize their use by non-target species that are not competitors of target species (though corvids may visit them); water availability should be prioritized where drought periods are expected. © 2020 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.","camera-trapping; feeding; game species; management; watering; wildlife","water; animal; animal food; drinking behavior; feeding behavior; photography; Spain; veterinary medicine; wild animal; Animal Feed; Animals; Animals, Wild; Drinking Behavior; Feeding Behavior; Photography; Spain; Water","Aebischer, N.J., Bailey, C.M., Gibbons, D.W., Morris, A.J., Peach, W.J., Stoate, C., Twenty years of local farmland bird conservation: The effects of management on avian abundance at two UK demonstration sites (2016) Bird Study, 63, pp. 10-30; Agresti, A., (2007) An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis, , Wiley, Hoboken, NJ; Andueza, A., Lambarri, M., Urda, V., Prieto, I., Villanueva, L.F., Sánchez-García, C., (2018) Evaluación del impacto económico y social de la caza en Castilla-La Mancha, , Fundación Artemisan, Ciudad Real, Spain; Arcese, P., Smith, J.N.M., Effects of population density and supplemental food on reproduction in song sparrows (1988) Journal Animal Ecology, 57, pp. 119-136; Armenteros, J.A., (2014) Aspectos más relevantes de la suplementación de agua y alimento para la caza menor: perdiz roja (Alectoris rufa, L. 1758) y conejo de monte (Oryctolagus cuniculus, L. 1758), , (PhD thesis)., Universidad de León, León, Spain, (abstract in English); Armenteros, J.A., Sánchez-García, C.S., Alonso, M.E., Larsen, R.T., Gaudioso, V.R., Use of water troughs by wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in a farmland area of north-west Spain (2015) Animal Biodiversity and Conservation, 38 (2), pp. 233-240; Armenteros, J.A., Prieto, R., Lomillos, J.M., Alonso, M.E., Gaudioso, V.R., Do wild red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa) use feeders?

However, in practice this is challenging, especially with wide-ranging, elusive and cryptic species or those that occur at low density. Here we compare two non-invasive methods, passive acoustic monitoring (n = 12) and camera trapping (n = 53), to detect chimpanzees Pan troglodytes in a savanna-woodland mosaic habitat at the Issa Valley, Tanzania. With occupancy modelling we evaluate the efficacy of each method, using the estimated number of sampling days needed to establish chimpanzee absence with 95% probability, as our measure of efficacy. Passive acoustic monitoring was more efficient than camera trapping in detecting wild chimpanzees. Detectability varied over seasons, likely due to social and ecological factors that influence party size and vocalization rate. The acoustic method can infer chimpanzee absence with less than 10 days of recordings in the field during the late dry season, the period of highest detectability, which was five times faster than the visual method. Synthesis and applications. Despite some technical limitations, we demonstrate that passive acoustic monitoring is a powerful tool for species monitoring.

Our models also incorporate imperfect detection as well as abundance estimation error for both species. As a case study, we applied the model to four pairs of mammal species in Borneo, surveyed by extensive and spatially widespread camera trapping. We detected different responses to elevation gradients within civet, macaque, and muntjac deer species pairs. Muntjac and porcupine species varied in their response to terrain ruggedness, and the two muntjac responded different to river proximity. Bornean endemic species of civet and muntjac were more sensitive than their widespread counterparts to habitat disturbance (selective logging). Local abundance within several species pairs was positively correlated, but this is likely due to the species having similar responses to (unmodeled) environmental conditions or resources rather than representing facilitation. After accounting for environment and correcting for false absences in detection, negative correlations in local abundance appear rare in tropical mammals. Direct competition may be weak in these species, possibly because the ‘ghost of competition past’ or habitat filtering have already driven separation of the species in niche space. The analytical framework presented here could increase basic understanding of how ecological interactions shape patterns of abundance across the landscape for a range of taxa, and also provide a powerful tool for forecasting the impacts of global change. © 2017 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation","Borneo; co-occurrence; competition; global change; Southeast Asia; species interactions","abundance estimation; assessment method; coexistence; detection method; ecological impact; ecological modeling; endemic species; environmental response; facilitation; global change; habitat fragmentation; interspecific interaction; mammal; tropical environment; Borneo; Southeast Asia; Animalia; Cervidae; Mammalia; Muntiacus","Akers, A.A., Islam, M.A., Nijman, V., Habitat characterization of western hoolock gibbons Hoolock hoolock by examining home range microhabitat use (2013) Primates, 54, pp. 341-348; Araujo, M.B., Rozenfeld, A., The geographic scaling of biotic interactions (2014) Ecography, 37, pp. 406-415; Azeria, E.T., Fortin, D., Hebert, C., Peres-Neto, P., Pothier, D., Ruel, J.C., Using null model analysis of species co-occurrences to deconstruct biodiversity patterns and select indicator species (2009) Divers.

Thus, forest health issues have received unprecedented attention, and have become an important part of the ecological civilization strategy. China's forest resources continue to grow, but it also faces some problems, such as single afforestation structure, low stand quality and weak ecological stability. How to evaluate forest health systematically and accurately is still a difficult problem. Compared with the traditional ground survey methods, remote sensing technology has the advantages of macroscopic, timeliness and economic efficiency. With the rapid development of high-resolution remote sensing and artificial intelligence technology, it is possible to overcome the problem of forest health assessment. In order to systematically evaluate the potential of new remote sensing technology, this paper points out the existing paths and methods on the basis of literature analysis, including: (1) through bibliometric analysis, four core contents of forest health assessment (vitality, organizational structure, resistance and resilience) and four key issues (tree species classification, forest vitality, forest pests, drought threat) were identified. (2) Systematically interpreting the advantages and disadvantages of existing remote sensing technologies from three angles, namely, different scales (single tree stand ecosystem landscape), different platforms (near ground remote sensing, aerial remote sensing satellite remote sensing) and different sensors (including RGB cameras, multi/hyperspectral cameras, lidar, thermal infrared cameras, microwave radars and chlorophyll fluorescence scanners). (3) Focusing on four key issues, this paper expounds the application path and method of remote sensing technology to evaluate forest health in recent years. Furthermore, this paper points out the challenges and opportunities, including multi-source fusion analysis, forest health monitoring network and near ground remote sensing, forest health big data application, in order to provide reference for the intelligent management of forest resources in China. © 2021, Editorial Department of Journal of Beijing Forestry University.

Tapirs are hunted in French Guiana, although a law introduced in 2011 restricts hunting to one animal per person per hunting trip. We carried out camera-trap surveys in the Nouragues Nature Reserve for 4 years, with the goal of estimating tapir densities in undisturbed conditions and determining sustainable harvest levels for tapirs in French Guiana. We analysed our data with a Bayesian spatially explicit capture-recapture model, with parameter sharing across surveys to improve estimates, and used the model to calculate derived parameters such as maximum sustainable harvest levels. Density estimates for all four surveys were similar and the model indicated a difference in encounter rates for the two camera models used but no difference in encounter rates or home range sizes for males and females or between years. Based on the calculated density of 0.32 tapir km-2 we estimated sustainable harvest levels at 0.009 tapir km-2. Comparing this value to hunting surveys from 11 sites between 1999 and 2006, we found that hunting levels were unsustainable in at least seven villages. We conclude that even the new restrictive hunting law will not prevent overhunting of tapirs in certain areas and thus stronger regulations are needed. However, because of the remoteness of tapir habitat in many parts of French Guiana tapirs are not immediately threatened in the country as a whole.

Numerous recent studies have evaluated the efficiency and effectiveness of camera traps as a research tool. Nonetheless, important aspects of camera-trap methodology remain in need of critical investigation. One such issue relates to camera-trap viewshed visibility, which is often compromised in the field by physical obstructions (e.g. trees) or topography (e.g. steep slopes). The loss of visibility due to these obstructions could affect wildlife detection rates, with associated implications for study inference and management application. Aims: We aimed to determine the effect of camera-trap viewshed obstruction on wildlife detection rates for a suite of eight North American species that vary in terms of ecology, commonness and body size. Methods: We deployed camera traps at 204 sites throughout an extensive semi-urban park system in Cleveland, Ohio, USA, from June to September 2016. At each site, we quantified camera-trap viewshed obstruction by using a cover-board design. We then modelled the effects of obstruction on wildlife detection rates for the eight focal species. Key results: We found that detection rates significantly decreased with an increasing viewshed obstruction for five of the eight species, including both larger and smaller mammal species (white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus, and squirrels, Sciurus sp., respectively). The number of detections per week per camera decreased two-to three-fold as visibility at a camera site decreased from completely free of obstruction to mostly obstructed. Conclusions: These results imply that wildlife detection rates are influenced by site-level viewshed obstruction for a variety of species, and sometimes considerably so. Implications: Researchers using camera traps should address the potential for this effect to ensure robust inference from wildlife image data. Accounting for viewshed obstruction is critical when interpreting detection rates as indices of abundance or habitat use because variation in detection rate could be an artefact of site-level viewshed obstruction rather than due to underlying ecological processes. © 2020 CSIRO.","abundance index; camera traps; study design; visibility","design method; detection method; index method; mammal; methodology; research and methodology; tetrapod; trap (equipment); wild population; Cleveland [Ohio]; North America; Ohio; United States; Mammalia; Odocoileus virginianus; Sciuridae; Sciurus sp.","Abade, L., Cusack, J., Moll, R.J., Strampelli, P., Dickman, A.J., MacDonald, D.W., Montgomery, R.A., Spatial variation in leopard (Panthera pardus) site use across a gradient of anthropogenic pressure in Tanzania's Ruaha landscape (2018) PLoS One, 13; Anile, S., Devillard, S., Study design and body mass influence RAIs from camera trap studies: Evidence from the Felidae (2016) Animal Conservation, 19, pp. 35-45; Bengsen, A.J., Leung, L.K., Lapidge, S.J., Iain, J., Using a general index approach to analyze camera-trap abundance indices (2011) The Journal of Wildlife Management, 75, pp. 1222-1227; Brook, L.A., Johnson, C.N., Ritchie, E.G., Effects of predator control on behaviour of an apex predator and indirect consequences for mesopredator suppression (2012) Journal of Applied Ecology, 49, pp. 1278-1286; Brown, B.W., Batzli, G.O., Habitat selection by fox and gray squirrels: A multivariate analysis (1984) The Journal of Wildlife Management, 48, pp. 616-621; Burton, A.C., Neilson, E., Moreira, D., Ladle, A., Steenweg, R., Fisher, J.T., Bayne, E., Boutin, S., Wildlife camera trapping: A review and recommendations for linking surveys to ecological processes (2015) Journal of Applied Ecology, 52, pp. 675-685; Carbone, C., Christie, S., Conforti, K., Coulson, T., Franklin, N., Ginsberg, J.R., Griffiths, M., Wan Shahruddin, W.N., The use of photographic rates to estimate densities of tigers and other cryptic animals (2001) Animal Conservation, 4, pp. 75-79; Carlyle, C.N., Fraser, L.H., Haddow, C.M., Bings, B.A., Harrower, W., The use of digital photos to assess visual cover for wildlife in rangelands (2010) Journal of Environmental Management, 91, pp. 1366-1370; Claridge, A.W., Mifsud, G., Dawson, J., Saxon, M.J., Use of infrared digital cameras to investigate the behaviour of cryptic species (2004) Wildlife Research, 31, pp. 645-650; Draper, N.R., Smith, H., (1998) Applied Regression Analysis, , 3rd edn.

Few studies have compared the quantity and quality of seed dispersal by megaherbivores versus alternative frugivores in the wild, particularly for plant species with fruit easily consumed by many frugivorous species. In a disturbed tropical moist forest in India, we examine whether megaherbivores are a major frugivore of two tree species with easily edible, mammal-dispersed fruit. We quantify the relative fruit removal rates of Artocarpus chaplasha and Careya arborea, by the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) and alternative dispersers. Through focal watches and camera trapping, we found the elephant to be amongst the top three frugivores for each tree species. Furthermore, seed transects under A. chaplasha show that arboreal frugivores discard seeds only a short distance from the parental tree, underscoring the elephant's role as a long-distance disperser. Our data provide unprecedented support for an old notion: megaherbivores may be key dispersers for a broad set of mammal-dispersed fruiting species, and not just fruit inaccessible to smaller frugivores. As such, the elephant may be particularly important for the functional ecology of the disturbed forests it still inhabits across tropical Asia. © 2015 Cambridge University Press.","Artocarpus chaplasha; Buxa Tiger Reserve; Careya arborea; domestic bovids; Elephas maximus; frugivory; functional ecology; Macaca mulatta; rhesus macaques","domestic species; edible species; frugivory; fruit; fruiting; plant-herbivore interaction; primate; seed dispersal; shrub; wild population; Buxa Tiger Reserve; India; Animalia; Artocarpus; Bovidae; Careya arborea; Elephas maximus; Macaca mulatta; Mammalia","Blake, S., Deem, S.L., Mossimbo, E., Maisels, F., Walsh, P., Forest elephants: Tree planters of the Congo (2009) Biotropica, 41, pp. 459-468; Campos-Arceiz, A., Blake, S., Megagardeners of the forest - The role of elephants in seed dispersal (2011) Acta Oecologia, 37, pp. 542-553; Campos-Arceiz, A., Larrinaga, A.R., Weerasinghe, U.R., Takatsuki, S., Pastorini, J., Leimgruber, P., Fernando, P., Santamarial, Behaviorratherthandiet mediates seasonal differences in seed dispersal by Asian elephants (2008) Ecology, 89, pp. 2684-2691; Cochrane, E.P., The need to be eaten: Balanites wilsoniana with and without elephant seed-dispersal (2003) Journal of Tropical Ecology, 19, pp. 579-589; Corlett, R.T., Frugivory and seed dispersal by vertebrates in the Oriental (Indomalayan) region (1998) Biological Reviews, 73, pp. 413-448; Corlett, R.T., The impact of hunting on the mammalian fauna of tropical Asian forests (2007) Biotropica, 39, pp. 292-303; Corlett, R.T., Seed dispersal distances and plant migration potential in tropical East Asia (2009) Biotropica, 41, pp. 592-598; Corlett, R.T., The shifted baseline: Prehistoric defaunation in the tropics and its consequences for biodiversity conservation (2013) Biological Conservation, 163, pp. 13-21; Corlett, R., Lucas, P., Alternative seed-handling strategies in primates: Seed-spitting by long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) (1990) Oecologia, 82, pp. 166-171; Datta, A., Rawat, G.S., Dispersal modes and spatial patterns of tree species in a tropical forest in Arunachal Pradesh, northeast India (2008) Tropical Conservation Science, 1, pp. 163-185; Davison, A.C., Hinkley, D.V., (1997) Bootstrap Methods and Their Application, p. 594. , Cambridge University Press, New York; Dennis, A.J., Westcott, D.A., Reducing complexity when studying seed dispersal at community scales: A functional classification of vertebrate seed dispersers in tropical forests (2006) Oecologia, 149, pp. 620-634; Dinerstein, E., (2003) The Return of the Unicorns: The Natural History and Conservation of the One-horned Rhinoceros, p. 384. , Columbia University Press, New York; Guimarães, P.R., Galetti, M., Jordano, P., Seed dispersal anachronisms: Rethinking the fruit extinctmegafauna ate (2008) PLoS ONE, 3 (3), p. e1745; Hansen, D.M., Galetti, M., The forgotten mega fauna (2009) Science, 324, pp. 42-43; Janzen, D.H., Martin, P.S., Neotropical anachronisms: The fruit the gomphotheres ate (1982) Science, 215, pp. 19-27; Jordano, P., Schupp, E.W., Seed disperser effectiveness: The quantity component and patterns of seed rain for Prunus mahaleb (2000) Ecological Monographs, 70, pp. 591-615; Kitamura, S., Yumoto, T., Poonswad, P., Chuailua, P., Plongmai, K., Maruhashi, T., Noma, N., Interactions between fleshy fruit and frugivores in a tropical seasonal forest in Thailand (2002) Oecologia, 133, pp. 559-572; Kitamura, S., Suzuki, S., Yumoto, T., Poonswad, P., Chuailua, P., Plongmai, K., Noma, N., Suckasam, C., Dispersal of Aglaia spectabilis, a large-seeded tree species in a moist evergreen forest in Thailand (2004) Journal of Tropical Ecology, 20, pp. 421-427; Kitamura, S., Suzuki, S., Yumoto, T., Chuailua, P., Plongmai, K., Poonswad, P., Noma, N., Suckasam, C., A botanical inventory of a tropical seasonal forest in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand: Implications for fruit-frugivore interactions (2005) Biodiversity and Conservation, 14, pp. 1241-1262; Kitamura, S., Suzuki, S., Yumoto, T., Poonswad, P., Chuailua, P., Plongmai, K., Maruhashi, T., Suckasam, C., Dispersal of Canarium euphyllum (Burseraceae), a large-seeded tree species, in a moist evergreen forest in Thailand (2006) Journal of Tropical Ecology, 22, pp. 137-146; Kitamura, S., Yumoto, T., Poonswad, P., Wohandee, P., Frugivory and seed dispersal by Asian elephants, Elephas maximus, in a moist evergreen forest of Thailand (2007) Journal of Tropical Ecology, 23, pp. 373-376; Mabberley, D.J., (1997) The Plant-book: A Portable Dictionary of the Vascular Plants, p. 1040. , Cambridge University Press, New York; MacNae, W., Fosberg, F.R., Lecythidaceae (1981) A Revised Handbook to the Flora of Ceylon, 3, pp. 195-202. , in Dassanayake, M.

Although most studies focus on carcasses of large mammals, small mammals that have been shot likely provide a significant food subsidy as well, particularly in parts of the western United States. Millions of small mammals are estimated to be shot each year for damage control and recreation, many being left in the field. Despite this prevalence of carrion, and the potential for scavengers to ingest residual lead from bullet fragments, the fate of these carcasses is largely unknown. We deployed remote cameras to observe which scavengers consumed shot ground squirrels (Urocitellus spp.) and black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) in 8 locations across Montana, USA. At least 5 species of mammals and 9 species of birds scavenged, including burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia). Scavengers fully consumed 66% of carcasses and partially consumed 9%. Carcasses lasted an average of 24.5 hours before the first scavenger arrived. Of carcasses that were scavenged, mammals ate 16% and birds ate 84%, with corvids and raptors consuming an equal number of carcasses. Common ravens (Corvus corax) and black-billed magpies (Pica hudsonia) visited the most carcasses and often arrived first. Scavengers consumed only 9% of the carcasses that were partially concealed by being inside a burrow. Overall, our results indicate that a diverse scavenger community consumes shot ground squirrels and black-tailed prairie dogs, and consequently, may be exposed to lead from bullet fragments. © 2019 The Wildlife Society. © 2019 The Wildlife Society","ammunition; bullet; ground squirrel; lead; Montana; nonlead; prairie dog; raptor; scavenger; small mammal","canid; hunting; prairie; raptor; scavenger; small mammal; Montana; United States; Athene; Athene cunicularia; Aves; Corvida; Corvus corax; Cynomys; Cynomys ludovicianus; Mammalia; Pica hudsonia; Pica pica; Raptores; Spermophilus","Barltrop, D., Meek, F., Effect of particle size on lead absorption from the gut (1979) Archives of Environmental Health: An International Journal, 34, pp. 280-285; Bechard, M.J., Houston, C.S., Saransola, J.H., England, A.S., Swainson's hawk (Buteo swainsoni).

In this paper, I outline a time-efficient procedure to collect data on flower-visiting animals. The objectives were, first, to model diel activity rhythms by using cosine-based mixed-effects regression models (cosinor method) on data from an established automatic video monitoring system and, secondly, to test the use of a cheap off-the-shelf digital camera modified for automated monitoring of flower visitors. Two different model systems were studied: foraging bumblebees visiting focal white clovers, monitored around-the-clock (193 h) to model diel activity; and honeybees visiting thistles, monitored over a shorter period (5 h) to test the applicability and reliability of a new method for monitoring pollinators. The data were automatically entered and processed using R-scripts after manual filtering of the images, obviating the need for manual data entry prior to analysis. For diel activity in bumblebees, the model that gave the best fit included the 24-h fundamental period and one harmonic, a 12-h period to modulate the signal, together with temperature. The bumblebees were exclusive diurnal, with activity starting about 5 h after sunrise, peaking sharply in the afternoon and ending about 1 h before sunset. In addition to time of day, activity also increased with temperature. The off-the-shelf digital camera, Canon PowerShot®, with motion detection script, was triggered by every flower-visiting honeybee. In addition to recorded visitor frequency and visitor duration, it enabled high-resolution images, which could be important for species identification. Automatic camera recording is advantageous for close-up monitoring, compared with continuous video recording, because the latter demands more time and effort in reviewing the material. It could be used to study a range of different species such as pollinators, on-plant behaviour of herbivorous animals, cavity dwellers or cavity breeders. Moreover, the procedures for automatic data entry, data processing and statistical analysis for modelling diel activity rhythms could have great relevance for researchers using other types of camera monitoring systems operating 24 h per day. © 2016 The Author.

Nest boxes have long been used to provide supplementary shelter sites in revegetated and regenerating landscapes, but limitations in their effectiveness when offsetting the loss of mature trees has led to increased interest in novel designs of artificial hollows. For example, mechanically excavating cavities into the trunk or branches of trees. However, the effectiveness of artificial hollows in attracting wildlife to visit small- or medium-sized, growing trees in human-disturbed landscapes has received little attention. In this study, we installed chainsaw hollows that were designed for small, hollow-dependent mammals and birds into the trunks of live medium-sized trees. We conducted a before-after control-impact experiment using passive camera traps to monitor changes in visitations by wildlife to (1) mature hollow-bearing trees, (2) developing trees without hollows (i.e. control trees), and (3) developing trees with newly installed chainsaw hollows. We found that, compared to large hollow-bearing trees and control trees, the developing trees that were selected for chainsaw hollow construction showed the greatest visitation rates by hollow-dependent wildlife (i.e. number of visits) during the “post-impact” surveys. Our results suggest that chainsaw hollows designed to replicate the external physical characteristics of natural tree hollows could be effective in attracting target hollow-dependent fauna to developing trees in regenerating and revegetated landscapes. Further studies are required to compare the effectiveness of natural hollows, chainsaw hollows, and nest boxes when deployed in a range of human-disturbed landscapes. © 2020 Society for Ecological Restoration","activity; artificial tree hollow; BACI; biodiversity offset; habitat restoration; nest box; supplementary shelter sites","anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; bird; disturbance; habitat restoration; landscape ecology; mammal; nest box; shelter; tree; Aves; Mammalia","Allen, D.H., (1991), Constructing artificial red-cockaded woodpecker cavities.

However, acquisition of such data, especially in large vertebrates, is a challenging and limiting aspect in many studies due to associated capture and handling. Ultimately, this prevents testing important hypotheses in wildlife ecology. We demonstrate how to overcome some of these challenges by improving the far-reaching potential of photogrammetry for wildlife. We validate a methodology using photogrammetry to acquire measurements of complex, curvilinear, morphometric traits (deer antlers) at long range (up to 200 m), providing a methodological foundation for further application to numerous physical attributes and species. We calibrated and validated two different photogrammetric camera systems and applied long-range photogrammetry to measure a suite of antler features from deer trophies positioned analogous to free-living, wild deer. We also developed, validated and described an efficient correction protocol to overcome the complexity of three-dimensional antler features. This complexity previously biased the acquisition of absolute measurements. Our measurement estimates were characterized by mean errors lower than 5% when compared to true sizes, with our correction protocol for antlers particularly effective and validated with independent antler sizes. Importantly, the estimated size rankings based on the true sizes were identical to the rankings estimated by photogrammetry in all cases. We measured antlers in free-living, wild fallow deer as a field validation and demonstration, showing how we were able to collect physical trait measurements of 230 antlers without capture. This non-invasive, remote and fast technique can provide valuable and accurate data allowing researchers to address new hypotheses by linking life-history traits to wildlife ecology, behaviour and management. © 2020 Zoological Society of London","bias correction; morphometrics; non-invasive; photogrammetry; secondary sexual traits; wildlife monitoring","deer; life history trait; photogrammetry; remote sensing; vertebrate; wild population; Dama dama; Vertebrata","Antognini, J.F., Eisele, P.H., Gronert, G.A., Evaluation for malignant hyperthermia susceptibility in black-tailed deer (1996) J.

These studies rely on a detailed natural history baseline, yet multiple manakin taxa remain unstudied, precluding comparative analyses and assessment of geographical variation. The Blue-backed Manakin Chiroxiphia pareola is a widely distributed species with four recognized subspecies; however, most published information on display behaviour, social organization and vocalizations are derived from an island population of one subspecies, Chiroxiphia pareola atlantica. To describe the social organization and patterns of activity of the subspecies C. p. napensis, we studied a population in eastern Ecuador and collected data from seven display areas or leks within the Tiputini Biodiversity Station. We used focal observations, camera traps and automatic song recorders to collect information for the field seasons from January to March 2013 and video cameras from February to March 2014. Males were active most of the day with a peak in activity at noon. Display areas were occupied by one to five males, ranging from > 2 to > 18 years old. The vocal repertoire included duet song displays and a variety of calls. We provide sonograms for all six observed vocalizations, including two previously unrecorded vocalizations for the species, and comment on the possible behavioural context of each vocalization. We describe five distinct display elements and the dance display behaviour, and highlight differences relative to other species of the genus. The first part of the dance display involved cooperative dancing, whereas the second part was a solo display, usually performed by alpha males. Our work reveals some differences between C. p. napensis and C. p. atlantica, such as a possible aggressive interaction between males of different ages and hierarchical status that has not been reported before and the apparent absence of mechanical wing sounds in C. p. napensis. The data reported here help advance our knowledge of the evolution of display behaviour among manakins. © 2017 British Ornithologists’ Union","camera traps; Ecuador; manakin; natural history; sexual selection; sonograms","aggression; behavioral ecology; cooperative behavior; display behavior; geographical variation; life history; mate choice; passerine; sexual selection; social organization; song; subspecies; trap (equipment); vocalization; Amazonia; Ecuador; Aves; Chiroxiphia pareola; Pipridae","Agranat, I., (2009) Automatically Identifying Animal Species From Their Vocalizations, , Maynard, MA, Wildlife Acoustics Inc; Blake, J.G., Loiselle, B.A., Estimates of apparent survival rates for forest birds in eastern Ecuador (2008) Biotropica, 40, pp. 485-493; Blake, J.G., Mosquera, D., Guerra, J., Loiselle, B.A., Romo, D., Swing, K., Mineral licks as diversity hotspots in lowland forest of eastern Ecuador (2011) Diversity, 3, pp. 217-234; Burt, J., (2006) Syrinx software 2.6 h, , http://www.syrinxpc.com/, Downloaded from, (accessed 4 October 2013); Buxton, R.T., Jones, I.L., Measuring nocturnal seabird activity and status using acoustic recording devices: applications for island restoration (2012) J.

We used transfer learning to create convolutional neural network (CNN) models for identification and classification. By utilizing a small dataset with an average of 275 labeled images per species class, the model was able to distinguish between species and remove false triggers. We trained the model to detect 17 object classes with individual species identification, reaching an accuracy up to 92% and an average F1 score of 85%. Previous studies have suggested the need for thousands of images of each object class to reach results comparable to those achieved by human observers; however, we show that such accuracy can be achieved with fewer images. With transfer learning and an ongoing camera trap study, a deep learning model can be successfully created by a small camera trap study. A generalizable model produced from an unbalanced class set can be utilized to extract trap events that can later be confirmed by human processors. © 2021 The Authors.

Although new occurrence records have recently been reported from different geographic localities in India and Nepal, there is still a lack of information on its biology and habitat use that are required for its conservation planning. Herein, we report results from systematic, long-term (2014-2018) camera trapping in Kanha Tiger Reserve, India, to evaluate the habitat use, suitability and activity pattern of the rusty-spotted cat and model its local distribution with habitat and anthropogenic covariates. Thick canopied forest and rugged terrain were found to be extensively used and preferred by the rusty-spotted cat. It was also recorded in the multiple-use buffer zone forests in close proximity to agriculture. The species is nocturnal and its activity seems to coincide with its major prey. The guiding philosophy of tiger reserves in India is to use the tiger as an umbrella species for biodiversity conservation, and often these reserves are intensively managed to enhance tiger and prey populations. This approach, however, may not cater to the requirements of other less charismatic sympatric species, and those of the rusty-spotted cat also need to be considered for its continued survival. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.","camera trapping; conservation planning; habitat use; Ivlev's index; MaxEnt","activity pattern; conservation status; felid; habitat use; India; Kanha National Park; Madhya Pradesh; Prionailurus rubiginosus","Aditya, V., Ganesh, T., Camera trap records of rusty-spotted cat Prionailurus rubiginosus and leopard cat Prionailurus bengalensis (Mammalia: Carnivora: Felidae) from Papikonda National Park, northern Eastern Ghats, India (2016) J.
